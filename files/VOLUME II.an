        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Good morning. Today's date is September 3rd, 2014 and it is about, I can't see</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>sic Kathy Alizadeh with the Prosecutor's Office and also present in the room are the 12 jurors and Sheila Whirley with the Prosecutor's Office and the court reporter who is taking down everything that's being said at this point. Just some preliminary things. First of all, did everybody get in okay, was there any confusion, you all got in okay? Well, did give you menus for today?</narrative>
        <narrative>All jurors indicate yes.</narrative>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> What I would like to at least begin explaining, and we talked to you about when you want to meet in the future. And we are going to accommodate you whatever time or date you would like to meet. Whatever you decide, if you want to meet, to continue to meet on Wednesdays because that's what you're used to, we will make this room available for you on Wednesdays, okay. We'll do something else with the new grand jury, they'll meet elsewhere. So I would suggest that possibly over the  lunch break today maybe talk amongst yourselves. During your lunch break it is not going to be recorded, you all can talk about amongst yourselves about future days. And then maybe at the end of the day today or after the lunch, we are going to need a list of some dates. Those dates are not going to be made public, we're never going to discuss on the record in advance what dates, you know, you're going to be meeting, but we'll need to know so we can start scheduling people. Keep in mind that unlike typical grand jury days, we cannot present evidence on this matter unless all 12 of you are present. I know you all have the phone number for the grand jury. If you all make arrangements to meet on a particular day and then, you know, somebody gets up in the morning and they're sick, they've got the flu, you're going to need to call as soon as possible so we can try to call people and head them off if they haven't already left their homes if one of you can't make it, then we're not going to be able to hear anything that day, okay? So the alternates, alternates will not be called in on  this, is that my understanding?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> That's correct, they're not going to have heard everything that you would have heard. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Typically the grand jury will hear a whole case in a matter of 15 minutes maybe, but that's not the case here, so there won't be any alternates that are going to be seated. All right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> So the way I would like to progress is that each day when we meet, we're going to try to be on time and start on time. I think that's respectful of everybody else. We know you are dedicating a lot of your time to do this, so we'll try to be more punctual on future dates. I also want to tell you as you notice we have some additional equipment in this room, there is probably more people in this room than ever before. I'm probably going to bring in some additional fans because it will heat up and get warm in this room. If anybody at any point feels like they're feeling, you know, a little overheated, please let me know because we'll take a break. With this door  open when I walk out here it is way cooler out here than it is in here. If ever you feel like you're, you know, not being able to be attentive because of the heat, stop us, okay. And what I would also like to do is every, the beginning of every time you meet is to give you an overview of what to expect for that day. This is not in the form of like an opening statement where I'm going to talk about what the evidence is going to be, I'm just going to give you the names of the witnesses that we expect to call and who they are and what we anticipate the content of the topic they're testifying about. As you have seen in the past, the witness will take the stand, be sworn, take the stand and then I will begin or Sheila will begin by asking the witness questions. And I'm not trying to say, I don't want to discourage anybody from asking any question that they want to ask, but what I would like to see if possible, because your questions might be answered later on in the testimony. Some of these witnesses are going to have lengthy testimony and at some point, you know, you might ask a question that I'll say he's going to talk about that in a minute.  If you don't understand something that's being said at the time, raise your hand, identify yourself by your juror number and say excuse me, I'm not understanding what you're saying right now. But if you have a question that he hasn't, the witness hasn't seemed to answer yet, if you want to jot that down in your notes then, you know, at the end, of course, you know, I will open it up to questions and Sheila may have additional questions or vice versa because we are taking turns on putting on different witnesses because one person can't do all of this. Are there any questions so far? There will be times when I'm going to hand out things to you like maps or reports of other people just so you can have them for your reference while you're hearing the testimony. I would encourage you to still pay attention to the testimony. It can be distracting if you are reading something that's in front of you while a witness is testifying, you are going to be missing something that's being said on the stand. Anything that we give you will be available to you at any time during the time you're sitting. Certainly for your deliberations if you wish to have items back that  you've seen before, we'll get those to you. When you do get maps or reports or anything of that nature, what I would like you to do is to just write your juror number on the corner of it, but I don't want you to put any other writing on it. If you have notes you want to take, put them in your notebook because as we've explained to you your notebooks are going to be private, they're locked up, nobody is looking at them and they will be destroyed at the end of the process here. I don't want you making notes on anything that is, you know, not your notebooks, okay. Can we agree with that? After our last session Sheila and I sat down and listened to some parts of the testimony, the mikes pick up very well. Remember last time I said I wasn't sure how that was going to go? So I was kind of encouraging people to lean forward. I think we're not going to have any problem as long as people keep their voices up, we should be able to hear everybody that wants to speak. And if at all, you know, you cannot hear a witness as usual, you know, you need to raise your hand, I can't hear you or I didn't hear what you  said. Any questions about that so far? Sheila, one other thing I forgot. So the next time we meet, we will need for you to be on time because Judge who is the grand jury judge, is going to be here before we start that day and she's going to read to you another charge. When I say charge, it is like she's charging you with an oath, I guess. That is having to do with the fact that you're session is being extended. So I told her, you know, what time I thought we wanted to get started. You know she's going to be here a little before that. So if we can make sure that everybody is here on time so, you know, she doesn't have to wait around for us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> What time we talking, 8:00 or 8:30.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> I think we were talking about 8:30.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> So 8:30.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> You all can be here by 8:30?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> You actually prefer 8:30? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay. Because 8:00 worked well. I think they prefer 8:00 to bring them in the way they did today, they prefer 8:00.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> So what time do you all think you can be here and seated for Judge</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>All indicate 8:00.</narrative>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> I will tell her to be here at 8:00 for the next time you meet. You have a question? I know she spoke a lot about secrecy and we all take that very seriously.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> I don't know the answer to that question. I do know what that is, so I will have to check with our people and see what they say about that. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> I can't imagine there would be a problem with that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> I didn't hear over here, I'm  sorry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> You want to go ahead and restate it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p />
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Because of what we are going to be doing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay, I didn't hear you.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> As we mentioned before, people in your lives know you are on a grand jury and have been. Of course, we're not going to disclose to any media outlet or the public in general your identities, but your families and your employers know that you are on the grand jury. But more importantly, what you are charged with is that you cannot discuss anything that you hear in here. So, you know, if you have conversations with your family or your employers about, you know, your meeting times and your meeting dates, how long this is going to take, that's up to you and I understand that that's something that you all need to work out with the people in your lives.  We would like to get this done as quickly as possible, but then again, we are not going to rush anything. If there is a need to meet until after the first of the year, that's what we are going to do. I don't anticipate that, but there is no way after this whole process is over that anybody is going to say we rushed anything, okay. I want you to have as much time as you need, hear as much evidence as you think you need to hear. If we don't call somebody that you want to hear from, we'll get them here, okay. So for the next meeting we'll start at 8:00, the Judge will give you a charge. Today we're going to have testimony on the investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown in the morning session, hopefully we can get done by lunch time. In the afternoon today you are going to hear a regular docket of cases that we need to move through the grand jury. After that, we anticipate that all of your, everything you will hear every time you sit will just be evidence on the investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown. I know this is different than other cases  because normally when we've charged somebody with an offense, you have the charge in front of you, you can read what the charge is, you can read what maybe the elements are and you don't have that in this case. I understand that that kind of leaves you not sure how you are supposed to look at this evidence. So after this morning session, Sheila and I will sit down and we will come up with statutes for you on the various degrees of homicide and there will be some other relevant statutes on the use of lethal or deadly force when, and possibly self-defense statutes, so you will have by the time you are here next time. We'll have that for you so you can kind of at least understand the law as you are hearing this evidence. We're putting on witnesses in a certain order because we're trying to make this easier for you to digest and understand the evidence as it comes in because unlike a trial, I'm not making an opening statement. I can't outline for you what all the evidence is. In a trial, you know, a jury gets to hear that, that's not going to happen here because I'm not making an opening statement.  So we're trying to put the evidence on in a more logical order so you can kind of understand as the witnesses progress, oh yeah, I remember hearing about that the other day. Urn, but as it happens, sometimes we have scheduling issues with witnesses, and sometimes things might be out of order. There might be an occasion where you hear testimony from a witness and then you say to me or Sheila, well, you know, what about that, was that found at the scene? Well, you're just, I can't answer those kind of questions for you, you're just going to have to hope you are going to hear evidence about that and at the conclusion of all of this, if you have additional questions and you give us those questions, we will see if we can get those answered through witness testimony, okay. I think the best thing for every day is for us to tell you how your day is going to go. So today you are going to hear from two witnesses. The first witness is St. Louis County Detective, Detective He is a crime scene investigator. He will testify about what he did in relation to his investigation into the incident that occurred involving the shooting of  Michael Brown, okay. We're going to see pictures, and some of them are going to be graphic and disturbing and I have to just get that out there in the beginning. The next witness we're going to hear from is going to be I will have him spell that for you. I don't want to misspell it. He is the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on the body of Michael Brown and he's going to describe his job and what his findings were, okay. So with that, are we ready to get started? Now, on the times for next week, we want to be in the garage at 8:00 so we can be here at 8:30, or we want to be at the room at 8:00?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> I think you want to be in the garage at 8:00, that way you can come through the way you did. That seemed to work very well according to So be at the garage at 8:00, unless you hear differently. I will call you if something changes, but 8:00 in the garage. That will probably put us at 8:30, ready for Judge</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> And that's kind of what I  told her earlier this week, 8:30, I thought. From a frequency or time allotment standpoint for future weeks, what is your anticipation from a need, eight hours per week, two days per week if we can do it, how do we balance with what you have available to present to us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> That's going to depend a lot on your schedule. Sheila and I have talked about this. It would be great if we could go five days a week for as long as it takes to get this done. As I said to Sheila yesterday, we're not going to be able to do that. In a typical case we have a year to prepare to put on evidence and we don't have that here. And so, and as you may, you know, find out as the testimony comes in, we may have additional witnesses that we don't even know about today that we will have to, you know, present evidence on. So that's going to be up to you. If you guys decide well, we'd like to meet for, you know, an afternoon on a certain day of the week and all day on Saturday, you know, or we'd like to meet two evenings during the week, whatever you all think is best. Understanding that the more often we meet,  the quicker this will go, but I don't think it is realistic for either side, our side as well as your side to think that we're going to have, be able to put this case on Monday through Friday until we get done. I just don't think we could do it. All right, you can talk about that during lunch what everybody kind of feels comfortable with as far as a schedule, okay. As far as my job, I know my session is to end next Wednesday, so will we get a letter stating the fact that it has been extended?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> We can provide that for you.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> will take care of that. Thank you.  of lawful age, having been first duly sworn to testify the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in the case aforesaid, deposes and says in reply to oral interrogatories, propounded as follows, to-wit: EXAMINATION</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p />
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Can you state your name and spell it, please?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Good morning everybody. My name is</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And where are you employed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I am a crime scene detective with St. Louis County Police.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Are you a police officer?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And can you briefly describe for the jurors what training you went through to become a police officer?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>After receiving a bachelor's degree, you attend the police academy. You start as a police officer like everyone does on the street in a patrol car. After different various assignments and training and interviews, I was accepted into the crime scene unit about five years ago. Once in the  crime scene unit, here again, subjected to another 10 to 12 weeks of field training and ongoing classes and training after that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What does a crime scene investigator, what is your job, what do you do?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Primarily our number one job is evidence at various crime scenes that we are requested to, photographing evidence, collecting evidence, diagramming scenes, videotaping various scenes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so you say that you have been a crime scene investigator now for approximately five years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. I was assigned to this unit in January of 2009.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And during the time you have been a crime scene investigator, have you also received any additional training either through course work or attending conferences or seminars that are particularly directed toward crime scene investigations?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Everything from interviewing interrogation techniques, to scene photography, setting up death cases, forensic anthropology courses, several things.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So as a general rule, before we get into the particulars of this investigation, it is fair to  say that you have to be called to a crime scene by other police departments or agencies; is that correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So you're not driving around in a van looking for crime scenes?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Not at all.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So you have a van that you use?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And it has all kinds of things in there that you use during your investigation; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Equipment, tools, supplies, those sorts of things.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so when you are called, are you on-call, like you could be called in at any time?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>There are 17 of us in the unit and we work, we cover 24 hour shifts. So at any given time there is a minimum of two of us St. Louis County crime scene detectives on duty, 24 hours a day.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>When you receive a call to go to a crime scene, you get your stuff, go, and you drive your van to the crime scene; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, typically when you arrive at a crime  scene, what's the first thing you do?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>First thing I would do is contact either the person in charge of the scene or an officer that knows what's going on. They would typically give me a rundown what they know at that time and walk me through the scene to show me, again, what they know, what occurred and where it occurred.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so it's, you are not the first officer arriving at a crime scene, other officers are always there before you; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct, yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so you talk with them about what they know, what they might have already found, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. Urn, and so after you get that information, is that necessary for you to then decide what you are going to document, what you are going to search for and so forth?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, it helps greatly knowing what they know and then I can take my time and start digging further into finding evidence and stuff like that. But knowing what they know prior to my arrival helps me establish a starting point for my investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And I would imagine every crime scene is going to be unique, correct? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Every one.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And whether it is a shooting or a burglary or sexual assault, those are all different crime scenes, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So after you have spoken with the officers there and gotten some information, what's the next thing you typically do?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I would walk through the scene with them, they typically would point out evidence that they've already found or stuff that may have obvious to them, stuff that other witnesses or victims may have shown them already. From that point, for homicide scenes and other death investigation scenes, the first thing that we would do is videotape a walk-through from my own perspective. Not with anyone narrating it or with anyone particularly in front of the camera, it would typically be just my point of view walking through the scene from what I know from that initial contact with the officer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And in these cases given that other officers are already there before you, is it usual that whatever they have determined the scene to be has been taped off with police tape, that yellow tape that keeps people out of the scene? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, generally that's the case. Oftentimes through the course of an investigation we may find something, obviously, that's outside the crime scene tape initially, but typically the crime scene tape is already up, a scene has been established for us and then we start our investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And I would imagine that, you know, what you were hoping for is to have a crime scene that is undisturbed, uncontaminated by anyone from the outside who is not involved in the incident itself, would that be fair to say?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>In an ideal world, yes, that would be perfect.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Does it occur that there is contamination of a scene either because of police officers being there, other pedestrians being there, emergency personnel, first responders being there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, absolutely, that's one of the tenets of crime scene work. That's a theory that anyone or any person that comes in contact with a crime scene you can either take something away, but you will always leave something there, be it footprint, steps, anything.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so after you have done your video  walk-through then, what's the next thing that you do?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The next thing we do is after we capture video, we take overall scene photographs. And again, it is photographs from my perspective of what is in place when I show up. If there is a police car that's shown up or crime scene tape, everything is left in place from when I get there and I take my overall photographs from what is in place when I get there. There is no way I can photograph stuff that happened before I get there or try to guess what it looked like before, so the photographs that I take from the crime scene are actually what I see when I show up.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So it would be against protocol to try to rearrange things so that they were the way somebody thought they were before you arrived?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So nobody touches anything once you get there and you then go through it, photograph everything as you see it; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then after you have completed photographing a scene, what do you do next?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Once we do the overall photos, we would  typically walk through and place down our number of placards to mark the known piece of evidence that we have recognized or determined at that point. After that, we'll start photographing those pieces of evidence individually and then once those things are documented, we'll then start moving things, looking for more pieces of evidence. We always want to be able to show stuff that was in place, how you would normally just walk in and see, there is always going to be hidden pieces of evidence that we need to move, either a car, you know, a couch, move cushions on stuff and start looking for additional pieces of evidence. And then we just restart the same process. Photographing it where we found it, putting a placard in place where we found it and then collecting it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then when you collect evidence after you photograph that evidence, you referenced a placard, is that, explain for the jurors what a placard is?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>A placard, I'm sure you have all seen them, they come in various shapes and colors. There is typically a hard plastic, for lack of a better term, with a number on it. And the only purpose  that it truly serves is for primarily me to recognize a photograph, what number of evidence that I'm picking up. Any given scene shell casing or a blood drop somewhere. If you find a picture of this shell casing 100 pictures later of a separate shell casing, it would be nearly impossible for you to determine which was number one and which was number 200. So a numbered placard is just a reference for my report writing and my evidence collection of what I've just took a picture of and I can reference that in my evidence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So after you have placed your placard and photograph the evidence items with their placards, you begin collecting pieces of evidence, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And you always have with you in your van envelopes, plastic bags, swabs, all kind of things that you might need in order to properly package pieces of evidence?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And you do that personally yourself?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I do. Typically in larger scenes there is always two of us there. One is keeping notes, one  is getting the piece of equipment for someone else. We are working together doing that, but yes, we all do pick up our own evidence and place it in individual bags and envelopes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So if it is a particularly large scene, it is more than one crime scene detective present at the scene. Is there one of you that takes over that that is your scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct, yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so the other detectives that are there are assisting you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So when you package evidence, do you mark the packages or envelopes or bags with your own handwriting and your notes denoting what it is inside and where?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>As far as the labeling on front of the various different envelopes that we have. One person may write that. The one thing if it is your case, in particular the Ferguson case was mine, some envelopes I filled out the front information, but on every envelope we seal it with a piece of evidence tape so it is closed and that is my initials and DSN on the back of every evidence seal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Each individual piece of evidence would be  packaged separately, is that protocol?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So after you have filled out the evidence envelope and sealed it with tape and placed your initials and DSN on the envelope, do you prepare an evidence sheet?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>A receipt?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Every piece of evidence has a paper trail, it has a receipt that denotes not only what the evidence item is, where it was found, but it also goes to a different part of our crime lab and/or property control. Our crime lab has three or four different wings to it, be it firearms lab, the chemistry lab, the DNA lab, any piece of evidence that goes to any part of those labs has to have its own individual receipt.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So this receipt that is with this packaged evidence stays with that item; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, not only is the evidence receipt, but also serves as the chain of custody but everyone that picks that item up has to sign off on it as the chain of custody.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And it is not unusual for items that you may have collected to go through a number of  different hands to get to its final destination, whether it be the lab, whether it be the fingerprint section, whether it be the medical examiner's office and so forth, several people may have handled this package, is that fair to say?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And those people have to sign off on that package?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then when they give it to somebody else, they have to sign that they gave it, and the person they gave it to then signs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And until the evidence reaches a destination where it is going to be examined or tested, does anyone open that package while they're handling it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Would you agree that it is the general policy of whether it is the St. Louis County Crime Lab or any other place, that if they were eventually to receive one of your evidence envelopes and the envelope tape has been torn or tampered with or in any way changed from when you initially sealed that envelope, do they notify you? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Typically. For instance, if I, when I package a piece of evidence, I would put it into our vault, especially if it is overnight. Typically these things happen at night or when the crime lab is closed. Whoever takes that piece of evidence out of the vault or in the lab, they are going to open it. So they will cut my evidence tape. When they're done with it and seal it back up, they put a piece tape over top of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Let me stop you, you are talking about a vault that's at the lab?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So that's after the evidence has arrived at the lab?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>But the people that may handle it before it gets to the lab aren't to open that evidence, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, typically I would be the only person that would handle that before it gets to the lab.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So once it is at the lab and you said sometimes if it is overnight, they have an overnight vault?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You can drop evidence in?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so you know no one else from the outside except the lab people are going to be able to get to that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Actually, myself, not myself, but crime scene detectives and our property control director are the only people that have access to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So once the lab people come in, they have one of you guys have to open the vault for them to get the evidence out?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then, of course, if they have to examine it for whatever testing or examination they are going to do, that's when the first time this evidence envelope is opened?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. If at any time there is a problem with the receipt, be it if you missed a signature on a receipt or if you have 30 envelopes of evidence and one of them does not have the seal on it, you'll get a call, a page, an email, they won't touch anything until you respond back down there to fix it before they will accept it as evidence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So the lab is charged with the duty of checking the chain of custody making sure that is  all copesetic?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Making sure the envelope is sealed and has not been tampered with?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then after you have delivered your evidence items to wherever they're going to go, the lab, property control, and property control for the sake of explaining to the jurors, what is property control?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Property control, obviously, the name explains a lot, they control the property. But they primarily take pieces of evidence that are not going to be tested by the forensic lab and fingerprints for that matter. If it is a recovered stolen bicycle from the back of someone's yard, that's not going to go to our lab for DNA testing, that's going to sit in property.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>It is what we would think of as an evidence room?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Exactly, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So after you have delivered the items of evidence to wherever you are going to send them to and let me ask you this, at some point there is  another officer who is in charge of the investigation, would that be fair to say?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And do you also take instruction from that officer on various parts of what you're doing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I'm assuming you are referring to like a detective that's doing the lead part of the investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They are oftentimes given more information, especially throughout the course of an investigation than what we would typically have at the scene. They are initially outside interviewing witnesses and other people, be it even a suspect and/or victim. At times what they will do because I'm given basic information when I show up to the scene, I'm typically not privy to the ongoing active investigation. So other detectives, be it homicide detectives or anybody else would come into the scene and go hey, we just found out this. Can you look for this. And then I may have a piece of evidence that I already collected that I deemed  important to the case, or I assumed it might have something to do with it, and I would think to send it to the DNA lab. Well, they may find out something and say can you go ahead and send that to firearms first before it goes to DNA, can you send this to fingerprints before going to DNA or vice versa. So they come in and ask certain things or ask that things be sent or certain things be collected that I may not have known about initially.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So, for example, while you are on the scene, a detective may come up and say, hey, the guy just told us he threw the knife in the sewer, now he is going to cause you to go look in the sewer to see if you can find the knife?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>After you delivered all your items of evidence, then do you make a report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And your report is documenting what, everything you have done at the crime scene; is that correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>My reports are not narrative filled, like typically police report it is basically an inventory  list. It is three sections or sometimes four, depending on what I do at different scenes. The first section is an inventory of the photographs that I took and what they show. The second section if I took latent fingerprints or developed prints, I would list where I found each print, the third section is just a list of the evidence I collected and where it was collected, what the evidence item is and where it was collected and the fourth list, the fourth section would be if I took video or did diagrams of the scene, which is me listing those things as pieces of evidence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And so lets get to the investigation that occurred at the scene of the shooting of Michael Brown. And so you were on duty on August 9th of 2014; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And about what time did you receive a call that you were needed to respond to the scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Shortly after 1:00 p.m.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And where were you when you got that call?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I was actually northbound on I-270 around Highway 40.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So how long did you go directly to the  scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Urn, I switched my radio over to the muni north radio, which dispatches for the Ferguson area, not for Ferguson, but for the munis in that area. And I heard several reports of gunshots being fired near the crime scene, so I stopped and put my vest on.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. What was the call involved in the shooting, what information were you given when you first got the call?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I was told that it was an officer involved shooting with a Ferguson officer and Ferguson had requested St. Louis County Crime Scene to respond.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So this incident happened within the city limits of the municipality of Ferguson, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And typically that would not be a jurisdiction that you would investigate in, they would have their own police department, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They do. They handle burglaries and stuff like that. We typically do not go in there for property crimes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>But in this case being an officer involved shooting, was it unusual for a municipality to reach out to the County and ask for their assistance or  ask them to take over the investigation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. We handle those type of calls for any municipality that ask. We also handle those calls for any department that uses the Major Case Squad.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So when you said that you, on your way, heard on the municipal radio channels that there were shots fired, are you talking about shots that were being fired after the officer involved shooting occurred?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So that caused you to decide to stop and put on your Kevlar vest?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. I stopped almost immediately, once I got it put on, I drove directly to the scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so what was the location of the scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I was given the address Canfield.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So how is it that from where you were driving you eventually travel onto West Florissant; is that correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, that's the round I took.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then from West Florissant you turn onto what street to get?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>You can turn directly onto Canfield and West Florissant. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So from West Florissant when you turn into Canfield, that's a residential area, isn't it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And after you travel some distance, not terribly far, you reach an apartment complex, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What's the name of that apartment complex?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I honestly can't tell you. I would just assume it was the name Canfield apartment complex.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So when you arrived, turned onto Canfield, did you notice a crowd?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Immediately. The distance from West Florissant to the scene, if I can recollect, is probably less than half a mile. And it is a residential street, all the houses have driveways, I have been on that street before. There is typically not a bunch of cars parked on the side streets and stuff like that, but as soon as I turned onto Canfield, I encountered traffic basically at a standstill. There was some officers that were directing traffic near the first cross street because people were pulling in, being told they can't drive through, trying to turn around and it  was a little bit of a mess when I showed up.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Were there also a number of first responders there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Several.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Police cars?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Ambulances or were they already gone?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I can't testify to that. I don't remember if they were there or not. I know there were several police cars and hundreds of pedestrians.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Hundreds of pedestrians outside of the police?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>This is in the middle of day, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Daylight hours?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Was it raining?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Sunny, nice weather.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So after you made your way through that initial crowd, did you arrive at an area that was taped off and you determined to be the scene of the crime?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so, what is it that you first did when  you arrived?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I first sought out whoever it was in charge. I saw some other officers and sergeants from my own department and I obviously made my way over to a group of people that were talking. They were expecting me and I just asked, simply asked can you tell me what's going on.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What information, when you say a group of people, you talking about police officers?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You didn't talk to any witnesses?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Or anybody in the crowd?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so what did the officers tell you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They told me that they had an officer involved shooting. They were pretty brief with me initially stating that the officers car is down there and at the other end of the street is the victim.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>When you, now, the initial call that came out for this, do you recall was this, how is this determined initially?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I was told officer involved shooting, that would be the typical term they would use when  talking to me on the phone.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, several of the items that you have packaged and also marked, you write or have indicated assault on LEO?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What does that mean?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>At my point in the investigation it is obviously right when everything starts and charges, determinations, names assigned to things aren't necessarily set in stone. So during my initial investigation, we are investigating an assault on a law enforcement officer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Were you told when you initially arrived at the scene that there was some type of altercation involving an officer and the deceased?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And was that described as an assault?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So when you began this investigation, you were characterizing this as an assault of a law enforcement officer, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is that in any way meant to be your opinion of what happened or who was a victim in this case? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. Any time I'm involved in an officer involved shooting, be it a fatal one or nonfatal, it is always during my initial investigation listed as an assault on law enforcement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so on various evidence items that you package on these sheets, you list a victim name?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And when you began this investigation, who was your victim name on these packages?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Officer Wilson.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>That would be the Ferguson officer?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Again, is that in any way supposed to be some kind of comment on whether you think who was the victim of this incident?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. That's how, when we list assault on law enforcement, he was the victim of the assault that we were initially investigating.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So did you immediately learn the identity of the deceased?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We had a preliminary ID. There was no form of positive investigation when I started my investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And so after having talked to the  officers about what happened, what's the first thing you did in this case?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>One of the sergeants with Ferguson give me a brief walk-through to start my investigation so I can have a logical starting point from where I would start my video, photographs and looking for evidence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So eventually you did a diagram of the crime scene is that correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am that's the last thing we do before we leave.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So given that it is the last thing, but I'm going to use it initially as one of my first things to help the jurors understand what is going on, but as I turn off of, as you enter the apartment complex and at the point where the crime scene is, Canfield is basically a straight street, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Where this entire scene occurred is a straight stretch of road.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And is it a paved road?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is it marked with any paint or lane parkers?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It has a center lane marker, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And is that a double yellow line? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And is this a street where there's a single lane of traffic that proceeds in opposite directions?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And Canfield is a street that goes east and west?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, at that point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. It is a curvy street?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>But at the point where your crime scene was, it is straight and it pretty much is an east to west street?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And when you started your walk-through with the Ferguson officer, did he direct your attention to Officer Wilson's vehicle?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And where, in relation to the deceased body, was the vehicle, was it</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The west end of the crime scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And then further east down Canfield then was the deceased?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so when you began your walk-through,  did you start on, what end of this crime scene did you start at?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Everyone that I spoke with, the Ferguson officers and my own department, we were on the east end of the crime scene near the victim or the deceased as it were.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Yeah, because I don't want to get confused using the term victim because some of your things are</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, they are.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Marked victim is Officer Wilson. So let's talk about deceased or Michael Brown in that term.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then any officer, the Ferguson officer by his name, okay?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>If everybody doesn't know as of yet, the officer that was identified to you as being involved in this shooting was Darren Wilson; is that correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. Q</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Okay. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So the vehicle was on the west end of the crime scene, Michael Brown's body was on the east end of the crime scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So when you began your initial walk-through, you started where the body was?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Are you videotaping at this point?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>When you are doing the walk-through then, did you notice that there were already items of apparent evidence or things of interest that had already been marked?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. There are a lot of times classes that are offered at their own police academy, basically road officers responding to homicide scenes. It is not only training, a lot of times kind of fall backs on common sense. If there is something, be it a shell casing or piece of clothing that you know is part of evidence or evidentiary value, most anyone will typically mark that, be it with a piece of crime scene tape or traffic cones, they will set stuff near items just so one, it is marked and they know where it is at.  Two, so someone doesn't accidently step on it or kick it or move it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So did you notice that there were a number of traffic cones that were already in this scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, as part of the walk-through they would say that cone over there is marking what we think is a projectile or that traffic cone is marking a shell casing and they would just point things out to me as we were walking through.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right. And so after you did this walk-through, did you walk the length of the crime scene going then west and then returning east to where the deceased was?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And also, just for the record, the street of Canfield at this point, are there sidewalks on either side of the street?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And there are apartment buildings, this is a complex that has a number of apartment buildings, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And the apartment buildings have parking lots?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yeah. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And there is entrances to the parking lots, there are streets that are coming off of Canfield, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So after you did your walk-through, what's the next thing you did?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Urn, typically at that point we would go back, my van was parked on the west end of the crime scene just west of where Darren Wilson's vehicle was at. We would go back there, I would prepare my video camera, you know, get a new memory card put in, write some notes down and at that point typically start my video walk-through of the scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is that what you did in this case?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Why not?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>As far as the exact times, I couldn't tell you, but during this time when we were heading back to my car, another round of gunshots were fired and extremely close proximity to the crime scene. There was obviously a large crowd reacting to that as well as a police reaction to it. And the decision was made almost immediately to kind of hold, make sure that our crime scene is secured. I have to be able to  concentrate what I'm looking at and trying to collect, versus trying to watch the crowd behind me that's growing ever bigger and more angry by the minute.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so there was a break in your investigation until you were comfortable that the crime scene was secured; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is anyone else processing the crime scene or do anything else or touching in the crime scene while you take that break?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. All the manpower there was utilized to try to secure the crime, just secure the perimeter of the crime scene. We had officers 10 feet apart, 5 feet apart every inch of the crime scene tape trying to keep people out of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>These were county officers, were there Ferguson officers?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>County officers, Ferguson officers, I guarantee you there were other neighboring municipality officers that were there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Approximately if you had to guess, how many police officers were on the scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>50, 50.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is that unusual in your experience? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Very unusual.</p>

          <p>Never.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so after this break until you were comfortable about the crime scene was secure, did you begin your video walk-through?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>And so are you the one who operates the camera?</p>

        </speech>

          <p>And do you shoot the video continuously during your walk-through or do you stop it at certain points?</p>

          <p>Once I start the actual scene video, I do continue one continuous video.</p>

        </speech>

          <p>And so you can hear things in the background, but you're not speaking on the video?</p>

          <p>Correct. </p>

          <p>And so after you did this video walk-through, again, where did you start the video walk-through?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I believe if you want to look at the picture of the crime scene as a rectangle, I started at the southwest corner, moved east to northeast to northwest in a counter clockwise motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. I'm going to hand you what we have marked, and I want to make something clear on the record, I believe the last time we met there was one item that was marked as an evidentiary item, it was a report for that witness. Just because to make it clear, that was, I think, marked State's Exhibit 1, which is typically what we do in cases. But because this is a grand jury exhibit, we're going to use different, call it something different. So we will at some point re-mark that report, which was State's Exhibit 1 and that will be Grand Jury Exhibit 1. Okay, it is State's Exhibit, it has the typical red sticker that has State's Exhibit, but it will say GJ 1. We are going to mark all of ours GJ and then a sequential number.  So I'm going to hand you what I have marked as GJ 2. (Grand Jury Exhibit 2 marked for identification.)</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh document. Do you recognize that?</narrative>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is that your diagram of the crime scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And that's the top page, correct?</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then the second page, what is that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Page two is a legend and it has measurement details and starting points and measurements.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And does this represent the crime scene that you diagrammed on that day?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>As I'm not offering a piece of evidence like I would in trial, I'm just going to put it up here for your benefit. And I'm going to have to move this for a second. I'm also at this time going to pass out copies of this diagram and the legend that's attached to it. And as I said, if you would just put your on it somewhere in the  corner and try to avoid making any marks on it or notes. These numbers, these things are kind of tiny, it might help if you can look at your own version, your own copy. Can you see okay from where you are sitting?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I cannot see the left-hand side of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. If you would bring your chair, maybe sit next to here. I don't want you to block the view, I'm going to get out of the way too once I get this situated. As best I can show that, can everybody see it? I'm going to move out of the way. So I put GJ 2 up on a projector so it is displayed on the wall. I have a laser pointer and so do you, Detective</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>And we see a directional arrow at the corner at the top right?</p>

          <p>Yes, indicating north.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Okay. And so if you were to drive in this  direction, you are going west?</p>

          <p>Correct.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And it eventually comes out and goes?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>A subdivision, I think it goes into another apartment complex and then into a subdivision.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And so when you arrived, you have listed or diagrammed here what is a vehicle?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, that is Darren Wilson's police car.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then you also diagrammed what appears to be a body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, that is Michael Brown's body.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then these boxes that are here that have numbers, it says Canfield?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Those are the two apartment buildings that we used as reference points for areas that we collected items of evidence. I can note out the addresses on here, I have it listed and from west to east. They are actually descending, so both of these buildings, while they are one  building, it contains two addresses. So the first address, this side off the left hand or west end would be , the east end would be So it is descending from west to east.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So now what is this object here that you've drawn?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This is an entrance to a parking lot and this is actually kind of a grassy hill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So a vehicle could pull into this area here and enter a parking lot?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then what about this right here?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same thing, this is a, this is an entrance to a parking lot for this building, this is an entrance to the parking lot for this building, and this right here is another entrance to a parking lot for a building.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So where you've got an arrow points to Copper Creek Court, that is a driveway that enters a parking area?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>That residents would park?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so when you are beginning to process  your crime scene, you start, do you start by taking measurements?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, measurements are the last thing that we do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And so in this particular case after you completed the video walk-through, what do you do next?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Urn, after we do the video walk-through, I would take overall scene photos of exactly how the scene is when you arrived before placing down placards or anything that I would do to assist in my investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so you take those photographs yourself?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And is that, do you use a department issued digital camera to do that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Does that camera have a memory card?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It does.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And after you take these photos, what do you do with the memory card?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The memory card is placed into a photo envelope and then taken to our departments photo lab. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, when you're processing the crime scene and you are taking photographs, do you ever delete a photograph like if you take it and you look at it and you see that's blurry or doesn't show what you wanted it to show?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. When the flash goes off, that picture is what it is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so if you hit that shutter button 300 times, you have 300 pictures that you send to the photo lab?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Whether it comes out blurry or unrecognizable, it is going to be printed, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So after the photo lab, and then let me ask you this, do you edit those photos in any way, do you on your camera, do you use color contrast or do anything to edit the image that you are taking?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, I do not.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And after that card then goes to the lab, does the lab print up your photos?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Do they call you up and say hey, Matt, photos are ready?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>For homicide scenes, part of our protocol  is we stamp each individual photo as an official photograph, but yes, they download our photographs from our memory card to their servers and then for homicide scenes and other various scenes where stuff is requested they print out 8 X lOs that we come down and stamp. (Deposition Exhibit Number 3 marked for identification.)</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh hand you what I've marked as GJ 3, which is a yellow envelope. Do you recognize your handwriting on that?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And when you received that, did that envelope contain photographs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I filled out this envelope and I put the photographs in here.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And the photographs that you put in there, were they the photographs that you took on the scene at Canfield that day?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And you looked at each photograph individually?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And stamped them with your stamp? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And initialed them and number each one individually, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>On the outside of that envelope, does it say how many photographs you took?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>161.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did you go through those photographs and assure yourself that there are 161 photographs in there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>I'm going to remove these photographs. And these photographs are not individually marked with stickers. So I'm just going to hand you the stack first and you had indicated that you put your stamp on the back?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And typically write the number and your initials, you didn't on that one?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I didn't put the initial on that one.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. Let's look at the first one and this is depicting what?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This would typically be your first and last picture and anything that's seen, it is crime scene information board. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so I'm going to put this up there. This has the date, the complaint number, which is what, what's the complaint?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Complaint number is basically your report number. I particularly put the county complaint number, which is denoted by our municipal code, which is 99, so our report number would be 99-14-43984. The smaller number you see lower right is Ferguson's complaint number, their mini code is 33-14-12391.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>The 99 is for county number?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That denotes county number.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>33 is Ferguson?</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Whatever sequential number is the next one up in the hopper is the number you get?</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So there you have written the number one?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And neglected to put your initialed on there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>But you recall taking this photo of the placard, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, I want to draw your attention also because this will become information later, there's some printing on the back of this photo that looks  like it is computer generated?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>I'm going to turn it around because it is upside down. Does this printing print out on each photograph as it comes out of the printer at the lab?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It does.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So it says on there SLCPD, that's St. Louis County Police Department, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then it says DCS, and then there's a four digit number?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And on this photograph it says 0001?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And the one is circled, did you circle that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then it says dot JPG?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then it says 0001 again; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So the printing that appears on the back of each photo, does it sequentially number these as  0001 and then the next one in order would be 0002 and so forth?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>As far as the DSC number, that's the number of the photograph on the file card. So this picture is number one, the next picture would be number two.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The second number that you see 0001, those are not always going to be in sequential order for this stack. Different things number, this one printed up three separate copies. So while this picture will always be number one, the next picture may have number four or number eight, whatever number that photo was print off. If they printed up four photos of that one, it would also be DSC1, the second set of numbers could be 001 through 4, depending on which number it was in the stack.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So the number that you circled, which is the first number, that's what we are talking about, this is your first photo?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. There are several ways to stamp the back of these. Some officers just use the official photograph stamp and would just circle that number as the image number. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So when you went through each of these photographs, did you check to make sure you had each of the 161 photos in sequential order?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then after determining that, you put your initials typically and you write the number on the photograph?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Not every detective does that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So we're just going do go through these. That was Image Number 1, which was your placard that you do at the beginning of every?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>And the first and last photographs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So I'm going to put up here, I'm not going to do this on everyone, but just to show you guys there's the number two, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then again on this photo it has got 0002 on there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>This is the second picture you took, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And after having looked at all of these  photos, do you feel that these photos accurately depicted the scene as you saw it that day?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>For the most part, yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. I want to make sure I get the whole photo. There we go. And so in Image Number 2, can you describe what is depicted there? And you can use your pointer if you want.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>I'm going to get out of the way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This would be the first photo that we took after the initial walk-through and the walk-through with the video. Some of the things that this video shows overall number one, here is where my crime scene van is parked. The traffic cones that you see are things that were set in place prior to my arrival. Different pieces of evidence, Ferguson officers or anyone else officer wise that were there that knew part of the story of the scene would denote that, you know, just kind of make sure hey, this is where this is at or make sure no one steps on it or moves it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Let me stop you here, Detective.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>I know some of you on the end may not be able to see the entire image because of the way that screen is recessed into the wall. So first of all, these photos will all be available to you to handle and look at at any time you want to see them, but if you feel that you can't see, you want to move your chair around here and again, if you are asking questions, just state your juror number, it doesn't matter if you are in order, just as long as you state your juror number.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>So this perspective where I'm standing is also where I started the video walk-through. It is the southwest corner of the scene. You can see this is Officer Wilson's car, down here you can see another Ferguson vehicle and another Ferguson vehicle down at the eastern end. Those are cars that were there when I showed up to start my investigation. So again, when I show up, I try not to move anything because I photograph how I come into a scene. Those vehicles were not there at the time of the incident, they were placed there by Ferguson officers to help secure a crime scene and to block views of Michael Brown's body.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So Michael Brown's body is in between  those two Ferguson police cars and those are SUVs, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. And you can see the corner of an orange body screen between the two cars, that is something that I set up after my arrival to assist in blocking views.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Why do you do that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>A number of reasons one, privacy. Two, seeing a dead body in the middle of the street is often disturbing to a lot of people. It is out of respect for the victim, out of respect for the family, out of respect for everyone to just kind of take away a visual sign of stress more than anything.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You learned at some point that family members of Michael Brown had arrived at the scene, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Were they allowed to enter the crime scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Initially, no. I think towards the end, not towards the end, but when the medical examiner had arrived and were getting ready to move the body, I believe Michael Brown's father, I think, but a family member was allowed to step inside while we,  the crime scene, while we removed his body as part of the investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So keeping anyone out, including family members, that's all because you want this crime scene to be as pristine and undisturbed as possible, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That's our goal, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so at this point, about how long into you being on the scene are we now?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>If I arrived 1:15 or so, probably find the time stamp on this photo, it is no less than an hour after I arrived just because in between this photo being taken and my arrival was when the gunshots were fired a second time close to the crime scene and everything was put on hold.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, this shooting occurred at approximately what time?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I think I was told 12:14, 12:15.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>A little after noon?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And were you present when the body was removed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And would it be fair to say that it was almost four hours later before the body was removed? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is that unusual that a deceased person would be left at the scene for that long of period of time?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, that is fairly common, almost routine.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And in this case, you mentioned that there were a number of times where everybody had to kind of stop what they were doing because the scene was becoming dangerous?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Not only do you have to take into the fact what we were dealing with at the scene security and personal safety, but St. Louis County, who was requested to the scene to investigate, we were not notified until almost an hour afterwards. If you look at the time of four hours as a whole, we only got there a little after 1:00 to start our investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So now in the photograph, I would imagine it is fairly clear to everyone, this is the driver's side of this vehicle, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And it is facing west, towards West Florissant, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>If everyone can look at your diagram, you diagram that as the vehicle, the rear left tire is over the double yellow lines; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, this tape that's wrapped around this vehicle, did you put that tape on there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right. Would you have typically done that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So that was done before your arrival?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And so you left it there and that's how you photographed it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>That's how it was when you got there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then these cones you talked about, these were placed before you got there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And during your walk-through with the Ferguson officer as you said, would you say why these cones were placed in various locations?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>If you all have a question about a  particular photograph, rather than having to say can we see that one again that had the blank, blank, blank, ask it now, probably make this go smoother. Yes? , this may be answered later, I don't know. I just want to know why is the door closed, do we have any idea why the door of the SUV was closed or was it reentered?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> That will probably be addressed by other people. This detective wasn't present beforehand and as he had said, his statement is this is how it was when he got there. So there will be other witnesses who are going to be called to testify being first on the scene, what they saw, whether they photographed anything, but that's the way he observed it. Any other questions about Image Number 2?</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh it has got your three on there. Describe what that image shows?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This is kind of, I moved slightly east from the first viewpoint, and typically what I would do when I'm photographing an overall scene photograph, I would stand in one spot and just pan my camera taking this angle, I twist, this angle,  twist, twist. So if you can picture laying four pictures out side by side, you would get, in essence, a panoramic view of the scene. And I would do this at this point, in the middle of the side of street, at the other end, go to the other side and just do the same thing. It is called bracketing photos.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And so this is just a slightly different angle from the previous image. You see your that's your van there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>On the left side of the image, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Okay. Anyone have any questions about this?</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Again, this would be, the left side of this picture would be the tail end of Darren Wilson's car, again, looking farther east.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. Now, I think if you can see, this is crime tape; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Police tape, and does it appear that there is police tape back there as well?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, initially when we arrived, this first  piece of crime scene tape was the barrier to the crime scene. After several people had torn down the crime scene tape, run onto the scene, the gunshots being fired, the crowd would run from this building in particular from this side of the crime scene, around this building, through the parking lot to this side of the crime scene, depending on what was happening. We had an opening where the crowd had run to the eastern end of the crime scene. So several people moved or put up a new set of crime scene tape farther back into the parking lot to try to keep people farther away from the crime scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So that was done not because you determined that somehow this area was now a part of the crime scene, it was done to keep the crowd from encroaching upon the crime scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So there's no particular processing of this scene, you didn't suddenly say I'm going to go and photograph and walk around this area?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. The only thing I think that we did in that area was film a witness' perspective with our video cameras and that is even farther back from where that crime scene tape is set. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Anyone have any questions about this image?</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh five. Can you describe for them what you're seeing, what this image depicts?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>From this angle, I think you are going to start to see that I am in the middle of what I would deem the crime scene looking east on the south side, I'm sorry, looking west from the south side of the road, and I will start kind of a pan from my left to my right. Again, you can see Darren Wilson's police car, the cone that had been set up, my crime scene van and then I had mentioned before my crime scene van was just inside the initial crime scene tape. You can see a crowd of people gathering there on top of this hill and, of course, you can see the amount of vehicle traffic that is now blocking Canfield.</p>

        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So the first series of photos you were closer to this area to where this police officer is, and you walk down here and take another series of bracketing photographs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>

          <p> Any questions about that? </p>

        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Similar image as before, I had just tilted a little bit so now you can see Darren Wilson's car is on the left side of the photo and I'm panning to my right, or to the east.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Image Number 7?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The center of the crime scene. I am basically in the middle looking from south to the north across Canfield.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Any questions?</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh describe what you see in there?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same scene or same location, I've now turned further to the east. This is, I believe this is Caddiefield, at the intersection of Canfield and Caddiefield. A Ferguson police car, an SUV was not described to me, was not there at the scene, it was put in place to block the body. Where the white sheet is laying between this police car and the orange body screens is Michael Brown's body. I'm not sure what department vehicle that is, again, it is a police SUV used to block this street and to assist with security at the crime scene. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So the two vehicles you see in this picture as far as you know had nothing to do with the incident?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Now, I'm now standing, if you get the perspective, the Ferguson SUV that was in the middle of the street is directly to my right now. I'm looking back west on Canfield. This is Officer Wilson's SUV.</p>

        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same view, I've stepped into the street a little farther this time. You can see this is the back of the vehicle that was blocking Michael Brown's body.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>11?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Standing in the same place looking east. I turned my camera to the north, that's the tail end of the same vehicle that you saw in the previous picture.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So this is looking north as you are standing on Canfield?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so Michael Brown's body would be  outside of the frame on the right?</p>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>

          <p>Image Number 12.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I've now turned, same viewpoint looking to the east. You can see the Ferguson police vehicle blocking this end of the crime scene, several cones that were placed out prior to my arrival marking evidence that they had located. Under the sheet is where Michael Brown's body is located. The sheet was also placed there prior to my arrival. The orange body screens are things that I added to the scene when I arrived to assist in our investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>From your perspective, the other Ferguson vehicle that was blocking the scene was in this direction; is that correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, it would be over my left shoulder.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>That hasn't been removed from the scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, it is still there.</p>

          <p>Number 13.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same standard view, I've moved from the street level back across the sidewalk to show a wider perspective. Again you see, you get a better look at the different cones were set up marking the  evidence around it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And just to clarify, this here is that Copper Creek Court on your diagram?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>So vehicles can drive up here and park back here, right?</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Standing further east looking back west you can see now that there is crime scene tape between this, my viewpoint and Michael Brown, give you a wider, overall perspective of the crime scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You are still looking west on Canfield towards West Florissant?</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So this vehicle, again, is not involved in the crime scene, it is blocking?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. The vehicle that you see in the far end of this photograph that's angled is Officer Darren Wilson's car.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, in the image, what is this thing right here on the ground?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This is a sand weight that is used to weigh down these body screens. They are made out of extreme light PVC and cloth, so any type of breeze  would move them. You can see that there are several weights holding down the feet of the body screens that are up. This is one that was just left there while we were there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>That is yours?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>It is.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>But not part of the crime scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Number 15?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same viewpoint. I think I just turned a little bit to the north side again because in the last picture, you could see Officer Darren Wilson's car to the far end, I'm just panning to my right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>16?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I've now moved to the north side of the street and I'm looking south. This is the car that was used to block the view of the body, the body screens that I assembled and set up. Again, the body screen weight that was left at the scene, Michael Brown's body is behind these screens, this is Caddiefield that you can probably see in your diagram, I think.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And now we see the crime scene tape along here and running across here. These people back here are just a part of the crowd that's gathered? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Approximately how many people, if you had to guess, bystanders that were just there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>In that photograph?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Just overall?</p>

          <p>Altogether, 3 to 400.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>I'm going to show you Image Number 17.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same viewpoint, on the north side of the street looking south. Again, the body screens and then this vehicle here is Darren Wilson's police car.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, at any time during the time you were processing the scene, did you feel that anybody, whether it was a police officer or a citizen in any way suggested that you not perform your duties the way you thought they should be performed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Were you ever told don't photograph this or in any way did you feel that someone was trying to influence you to do something other than what you felt you would typically do?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, not at all.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Looking at Number 18.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same viewpoint, I've now turned almost completely east. This is the vehicle blocking  Michael Brown's body. His body would be just to the left out of frame and this is Darren Wilson's police car. I have a question, are you by yourself as you are walking around doing these photographs or anybody with you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>During the video process of it, since it is a continuous video, at this particular scene I typically would have one person, another crime scene detective that is assisting me walk with me, basically with a hand on my shoulder making sure I don't trip over something in a hallway or a street, because I'm looking directly at that view finder so I can get the perspective I want to. This particular case there was, I was running the video and I had three other crime scene, two other detectives and my detective sergeant. One was guiding me so I didn't trip or step on anything, the other two to get the perspective for the video. I had to get very close to the crowd. So the two people that were assisting him were making sure the crowd wasn't going to grab, push, throw, do something to us. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Short answer no, I don't do videos by  myself, photographs I do, I do by myself.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh determination in what's being photographed, nobody says take a picture of this, don't take a picture of this?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>They might point out?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They can point out something that they would like to have a photograph of as part of their investigation. But never have I been told don't photograph this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. Number 19?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This is from the same view point as the previous picture. We use 18 to 35 millimeter lenses. I just zoomed in to the 35 millimeter to show perspective of Darren Wilson's police car.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Number 20?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. From the last perspective I have was standing here looking almost directly east. I've now moved to the center of the north side of Canfield looking back east. Again, Caddiefield is, that's the street sign for Copper Creek Court and then Michael Brown's body.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So Darren Wilson's vehicle is down this street to the right? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And that's 21, I believe, let me look.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Yes, 21?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same perspective. I've now twisted to my right. Caddiefield Court would be to your left. You can no longer see the street sign just looking to my right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Number 22. You want to hand them to me?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I can, I can probably put them up on this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You want to do that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I can.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>This is number?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>22.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>22. That will make it easier.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Same perspective. The vehicle that was in view in the previous photograph is partially cut off. I'm panning farther to my right showing my bracketed part of the scene. Any questions? Photo Number 23. Same as before, turning farther to my right. Now you can see Darren's police car within the scene and the cones marking different pieces of evidence. Number 24. Almost the exact same photo as before. I think I may have zoomed in to  show the area which we were looking at. Number 25. I didn't initial it. As the perspective goes from the diagram, I'm now standing on the northwest corner of the crime scene looking east, Caddiefield is on your right, Copper Creek Court is here on your left, and then the two vehicles that were blocking Michael Brown's body. Number 26. Same perspective just, turning to my right bracketing the photo. Number 27. Turning farther to my right, you can no longer see the two vehicles that were blocking the body and this is the center of Canfield. Number 28. I'm on the north side of the road facing almost directly south in the middle of the crime scene. You can see on the right-hand side of this photograph, the back end of Darren Wilson's police car that has the crime scene tape applied directly to it. The crime scene tape that you see on the ground again from one of the earlier photos, that was one of the crime scene tape officially put after the crowd moved. They were able to take that down and move that crime scene perimeter back. Number 29. Panning to my right  further, the previous picture you could see the tail end of the car. Here again is the police car in its entirety and the tape had been torn down. Number 30. I've now moved farther to the west. Still on the north side of the street, this is the front end of Darren Wilson's police car.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, let me stop you here. As a part of the scene like this type of scene, if you had noted or scene, for example, tire marks, whether they are skid marks or marks in the grass indicating possibly, you know, the travel of the vehicle, the speed it was traveling and so forth, and you're not an accident reconstruction person, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>If you had seen tire tracks, like skid marks around this vehicle, would you have documented those?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, that would have been something that I would have recognized as probably important to the scene. No tire tracks of any sort, any skid marks or I didn't notice any and none were brought to my attention and I didn't document anything.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And in preparation for your testimony today, did you and I look in these photographs and did you look to see if you could see in those  photographs?</p>

          <p>We did, yes.</p>

          <p>Did you see any type of tire marks or skid marks?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, it was images that we looked at that had closer views of the tires on his police car that were actually focused on pieces of evidence, and we could not see any type of skid or tread mark anywhere.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And those pictures are included in your batch of pictures?</p>

          <p> Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Number 31. Same perspective where I had moved, I could see in front of Darren Wilson's police car. Now looking back farther to the east, kind of bracketing photos from my right to my left this time. Number 32. Same perspective. Turned  from the northwest corner looking almost directly east. Number 33. Same perspective again, 18 to 35 millimeter lenses. I just zoomed in that perspective to give you an idea what we were looking at farther down the street.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh walk closer to that scene?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. Just zoomed in from the previous perspective. Number 34, the first group of pictures were what we refer to as my overall photos of everything. Now is when I would typically start taking my individual photos of items of evidence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So can you describe what number is this, 34?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This is number 34, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What is this picture and why you took it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Okay. As a procedural thing, if I'm going to do my evidence in order, you can see now you will see the yellow evidence tents are placed down throughout the scene. In particular number one. In a perfect world, you would take a photograph of evidence number one, you move to number two, number three just to keep everything in order and that's  the order that we find things. There is not necessarily a rule or law that says the item that you see first has to be number one and everything has to go in order. It could very well, for instance, in this scene, if I marked number one and number three, or that's number two there, I could mark 1 through 30 and then when we're getting ready to go find a shell casing on the other side of number one and have that be evidence item number 31. So it is not necessarily in the physical space things are numbered, they are numbered how we find them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So during the first series of photographs that we've seen and that was kind of your walk-through of the scene?</p>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did you take a break and then place placards in areas or were those placards visible in your earlier photographs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, they are not visible in the overall photographs. The overall photographs I take right after the video is done to show an overall view in pictures, not just video, of what the scene looks like when I arrived.</p>

          <p>So after you've got done with the overall  walk-through photographs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is that when you then go through the scene and put placards down?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>At that point I would walk through and placard items that I know our evidence. Things that are pointed out to me that were noted by the traffic cones first responding officers put down that they saw, and I would put my placards there on those pieces of items. During that time you may notice another shell casing or something else and, of course, we would placard that. Once those things are placard, we start taking our overall photos and close-up of each placard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>These items that have a placard, and I think maybe you can see that that is number one there, does that correspond with your diagram where you have a number one with a circle on it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>At this point after having documented these placards and you said you took measurements at a later time, those items that are numbered are depicted on the diagram?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct, on the diagram. All the little  bubbles you see, and that's not the best copy of it, but all the small circles that you see have a number inside of them denoting that item of evidence and its location at the scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then the legend that's attached to that diagram would tell you what number one is?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And so number one here by the tire, of the front left tire of Darren Wilson's vehicle, what is that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I don't have my list. I'm not sure, is it a bracelet?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Here, is this yours?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is a black and yellow bracelet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then this thing right here, number two, what is that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>A red baseball cap.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Number three?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>A spent .40 caliber shell casing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Any questions so far? Number five is another black bracelet?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Thank you.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Okay. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, sir. When you, I guess, put the placards down.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. Was there anything that you found on your own or was everything already marked?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, there were several items that I found on my own afterwards.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. You said that three and four were .40 caliber spent casings, on the list it says Federal, what is meant by Federal?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Federal is a brand name. Federal is the name of the brand that is actually stamped on the tail end of the bullet. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Any others? Okay.</p>
        </speech>

          <p> Any time you want to take a break or stand up, feel free to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The previous image was kind of an overall view of the several placards that you could see. So  in the previous image you saw what I would term overall view. This would be an intermediate view kind of referencing where in space placard number one is, you can still see the driver's front wheel of that. Image 36. This would be the close-up view of item number one. This is a hard plastic placard that's number one, that has a scale printed on it to show size. And that's the black and yellow white bracelet.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh know if that bracelet has anything to do with your scene or the incident?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You are photographing things, you're not sure what involvement they may, they may have direct relation to the incident, they may have no relation to the incident?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. Image 37.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Can you twist it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. This would be the overall view that I would show starting to zoom in on item number two, again, giving reference in space how it is located to Darren Wilson's vehicle. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> I will tell all of you that when it comes time to you actually looking at the photos, they are not as blurry as what you are seeing up here.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Thank you for clarifying that. I do take better photographs than that. Image 38. This would be the intermediate view of evidence item number two. Image 39. I think we spoke about this yesterday, the evidence item placard number two has an asphalt mark, tar mark in the middle of the placard. Has nothing to do, this is showing evidence item number two, just happened to be there in the photograph.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh right?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That is the traffic cone that was in place prior to my arrival marking the location of that piece of evidence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So you don't remove the traffic cones when you are doing this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. Had that traffic cone not been there, would have placed that placard to the right side of the cap then? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Probably. Okay</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I try not to move anything when I'm placing my placards. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image Number 40. We were going towards, I think that's item number three, again, my overall view showing space where it is located on the driver's side. Image 41, intermediate view of item number three. Image 42, would be my close-up view of item number three, which again is the spent .40 caliber Federal shell casing.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh question. I want to clear up something, some people might perceive, are you in any way saying that that was the third shot fired by giving that number three?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Are you able to determine when you are collecting these shell casings in what order these shell casings were fired out of a weapon?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So each little shell casing doesn't come  with a number on it that you put in your magazine in a numeric way?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, they do not.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>It would help you if they did, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Tremendously so. These things, the numbers, the placards in any of my photos and most anyone they have nothing to do with the order in which things were done during a crime. They are specifically the order in which we found that piece of evidence, and the number that's assigned to it is just to help us determine which piece of evidence it is. Has no other chronological significance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So in your report you refer to that this is evidence item number three in the envelope it is packaged in, it is denoted as evidence item number three?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>With a description?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So it keeps that number?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>This shell casing that you photographed is still number three, your evidence item number three?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is my evidence item number three.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.  I don't know too much about guns and stuff like that, so from that shell casing, where is the front of the bullet, where is the back of the bullet, can you tell me what direction it is facing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Let me clarify something here. We will have ballistics people, let me ask you detective, are you trained in firearms?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, I am a firearms instructor for our police department.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh within your expertise to talk about, this is called a cartridge; is that right?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Casing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>A casing. You are able to answer her question, you feel comfortable doing that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, I can do that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>As far as the direction the bullet is facing, I can't tell you, but as far as what you would determine the front would be where the actual bullet itself would come from, would be this hollow end of the shell casing. You talked a second about how that happens, how a  handgun goes through that process, how casings are ejected, it doesn't happen every time they fire a bullet. How far do you think they might travel, anything about that for people that are not familiar with that? You might want to address that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> You know what, I would like to talk about in answer to your question is his familiarity with cartridges and shell casings and projectiles and firing pins because he can testify about that, but as far as like how they're ejected from a particular gun, how far they travel, I believe we had this conversation before today, you feel that is outside of your area of expertise?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Far outside.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> If you want to ask him questions about how, what the components what we normally think of is a bullet what are the components, what happens to it when it is fired, I think he can answer that. Just to rephrase, one of these casings is ejected every time this weapon is fired, this particular weapon is fired, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>If it functions properly, correct. All right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Any other questions?  Are we also to expect all of these listings for a casing are from Officer Wilson's gun at the time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> We will have testimony that will talked about their comparison. As you recall he talked about taking items of evidence to the lab and our laboratory has a ballistics section. So at some point you will hear about the testing that they did and they will refer to this as evidence item three, but to make it even more confusing for you, the lab will give it it's own number. It will be like Q7 or something. But there will always be paperwork to show that this shell casing right there was picked up by this officer and put in an envelope and it is forever his evidence item number three. It might have another lab number that the lab uses and then someone who is going to testify about what they did with this and what conclusions they draw from their examination. Okay, thank you.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 43. This would be my overall view of evidence item number four, which is down here in the lower part of the photo.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh  vehicle?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct, you can still see the placards for one, two and three.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 44. In the previous image I was standing on the southern side of the road looking north, and you can see item number four. What they typically will do again in a perfect world is you always try to angle your placards all facing the same direction. So if you are standing in the middle of the road, you can see the number of each one because they are basically a triangle. And turned to the side you can't see what number it is on. So in this photo all I did was turn or moved to my left a little bit so you can see the front of the evidence placard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Can I ask you, and you can see it also in Image Number 43, and you can kind of see it in this image, but there is a thing that's down here that's yellow?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I believe that is actually a knotted up piece of crime scene tape.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So that's not a placard?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, it is not a placard. I believe  initially that was laying down somewhere around here near this item number four, which is another shell casing. When and/or something moved or threw it down on the sidewalk.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So that yellow thing right there has no, as far as you know, no evidentiary value?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You didn't seize it or package it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 45. Close-up view of item number four, another spent shell casing. Image 46. I've now moved over to the northern side of the street and this is my overall view of evidence item number five. Again, in a perfect world, the attempt is made to photograph items of evidence in the order that I find them. Image 47. Intermediate view of placard number five. Image 48. Clarify this as again another intermediate view. You can still see part of Darren Wilson's police car, be it that may be a running board somewhere at the bottom of his vehicle, again, placard number five.  Image 49. Close-up view of the vehicle, the bottom of the vehicle can no longer be seen. My evidence placard and then a black beaded bracelet. Image Number 50. This, looking at the next photo, this is an overall view of evidence item number eight, I think the last one we had was number five. Again, the ideal world you can photograph everything in sequential order. I believe items number six and seven were farther down the street. So at the time that this photo was taken, I didn't want to move down the street and then move back. Eight and nine were right in front of the car. I stayed in this area to continue with the photograph, this overall view. What we are looking at here is a red stain on the driver's door. Image 51. You can see this is what we would use as a placard. There is some adhesive removable stickers that are numbered one through zero or one through nine and zero that we can make combination of numbers. Obviously, this is something that we would typically stick on a vehicle or a window or something that we can't stick a placard onto, just to number in our photographs as  evidence item number eight. It is denoting a red stain below that. 52, Image 52. This would be the close-up view and again, it is not in focus with the projector, but you can see that the placard number eight is there, it has a small scale and items of this nature. We would typically insert my own visual scale in the photo to show size and shape of whichever item I'm photographing at that time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, Detective all of these systems so far that you've testified about are all things that you at some point picked up and put them in an envelope and packaged them, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So this is a red stain that is on the side of a vehicle, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did you seize that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And how do you seize something like that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This particular piece of evidence, we call it a red stain, it was actually kind of, I don't want to use the term fleshy, but it wasn't like a liquid. I was actually able to seize that with a pair of tweezers. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So that red thing just kind of peeled off the car?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It came off completely, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And you packaged that substance or whatever it was?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Was, in your experience with working with, for example, you know, blood stains or blood spatters, did it appear as if it was a blood droplet or spatter?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So it was something else?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Something else.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 53. Overall view, what this is looking at this is obviously, not obviously, still the driver's side of the vehicle, rear passenger door, the rear tire here. You can see the placard I put on there. Again, was an adhesive sticker for number nine. It is covered up partially by the police crime scene tape that was applied by Ferguson prior to our arrival.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So to find that item number nine, you actually lifted up the crime scene tape to look at the vehicle, but then once you placed a placard on  the car, you put the crime scene tape back where it was?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So you did move something on the crime scene, but only to search for evidence?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Image 54. You can see this photograph, crime scene tape is no longer there and basically what's happening is I am holding the crime scene tape up with my left hand and taking the picture with my right hand.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And what is Exhibit 9 or what is your item number?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Number 9 is a red stain on the exterior of the driver's side rear door.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. On the driver's side rear door?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>It is a four door vehicle?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. A lot of times people use left, right sided vehicle, that often still confuses me. I use driver and passenger side. This would be a close-up view of the red stain on the driver's side rear door. Again, adhesive sticker, and the evidence below it. Image 56, this would be the previous  photo was shot more at an angle or somewhat of an angle. This you can see the crime scene tape, I can no longer hold it up with my left hand and hold my scale and tape. So I pushed it down below the item of evidence so I can again put my scale into the photograph so you can show the size and shape of the red stain.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, did you seize that item number nine?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, this particular piece of evidence appeared to be some type of dried liquid. I was able to collect it with a DNA swab.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So do you have swabs that you carry in your van?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, sterile swabs from the manufacturer, sterilized water that we use to wet it. It is oversized professional Q-Tips. We wet the end of it, that piece of evidence we were able just to collect it with a Q-Tip and put it into a package and submit it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>The entire time you are at the crime scene, are you wearing latex gloves?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, 90, 95 percent of the time if I'm at my van doing paperwork, it is not always easy to write paperwork, but any time I leave my van, majority of the time between collecting different  items of evidence, you change gloves between those items.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So the tools that you use to collect this are in a kit that the police department purchases from a company, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Our crime lab.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>They are sterile?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>They are specifically for the purpose of collecting items that might be analyzed for DNA at a future time?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So no one else's DNA would have been on that Q-Tip prior to you opening that package and then rubbing, you said wet the Q-Tip with sterile water?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then you basically rub it on that stain?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>In essence, is it somewhat, it then changes that stain, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It does. Generally the stains that are  that small, the stain is gone when we collect it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Obviously outside of microscopic traces that would still be left on there, to the naked eye I took that stain off of there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then regarding evidence item number eight, the substance that you removed with tweezers?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>The tweezers that you use, are those also</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Again, supplied by our crime lab, sterilized individually packaged, they came out of the same DNA kit.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You open up those?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>One time use.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You throw them away when you're done?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Sheila Whirley. What do you do with those items like number eight and number nine that you seize once you seize them, what do you do with them?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Number eight, since I was able to take it off with as a whole with tweezers, it was put on a piece of what we refer to as way paper, kind of wax paper. This is in our sterilized kit. It is folded  so it doesn't get lost. And that folded piece of wax paper is then placed inside of a coin envelope and that envelope is sealed. Item number nine, since we use Q-Tips, we have these basically long Q-Tip boxes and again, they are provided by our crime lab. They come from a sterile environment, they are inside our DNA kit. You don't handle them without gloves. Each individual swab, be it a touch DNA swab or swabbing of a red stain or buccal swab to collect someone's DNA goes into its own individual swab box.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> And then what do you do with it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Once they are in the swab box, they go in an evidence envelope.</p>

          <p> For the purpose of?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Sealing that as my piece of evidence and taking it to the crime lab and keeping it as sterile as I can.</p>
        </speech>

          <p> Thank you. That was all.</p>

          <p>57. This is a series of photos that I'm attempting to show the driver's side mirror being pushed outside of its natural position. This is something that was brought up as part of the  investigation just because we were told that there was a struggle in and/or around the police car. This was an item of evidence like hey, that mirror may have been pushed during the struggle. You make sure to note that in your photos.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh example that somebody had pointed out this may have some relevance to the actual incident and so go ahead and photograph that and document it?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So the mirror on that police car, is it a mirror that can move? You don't break it by moving it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, it is not broken, it is like many new cars nowadays, it swivels and moves front to back.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>If you are sitting in the driver's seat, the mirror is pushed forward to the front of the vehicle?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>If you are sitting in the driver's seat, you can't use that side mirror at that point to check?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, you would not be able to see that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 58. Intermediate view, same  driver's side mirror pushed to the front.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And this thing right here, what's that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That would be the spotlight that's accessible from the driver's side you operate with your left hand. Is that mirror intact or is it broken?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is intact. The next photo is a little bit closer up so you can it. Is the driver's side window open or closed, I've haven't been able to tell in the photos?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is not there right now, it is down. It is open.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Did you determine that the window was broken?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It had been broken out.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh is broken and there is no glass in the door frame of the driver's side window; is that correct?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And then</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Actually, the glass, the broken glass is still within the door frame itself, but as far as intact window that would be able to roll up and roll  down or be halfway up is not there. To clarify there is no glass fragments outside the car or inside the car, it was all contained within the vehicle.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, we talked about this. There is definitely glass inside the car. You can see broken glass in the seat and the floorboard. To my knowledge, I do not remember glass outside of the car. Image 59, it is much clearer than the actual photograph, it is a closer up view of that mirror. You can also see item number eight is still on the car as of this time. Image Number 60. Several things you can see in this video again, it is still</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did say video. Image, you can see in this image, you can still see the crime scene tape is there. Evidence item number eight with the placard or sticker is still next to it. Nine, I believe, is now underneath this crime scene tape. What we are focusing on in this photograph is a defect to the exterior side of this door. Image 61, intermediate view of the same defect. This would be the handle to the  driver's side front door. It is just below. Image 62, a view straight on to the defect with my scale in the photo to show size and shape.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh second. I think you need a break, he's the one whose fingers are flying a million miles an hour. Let me just finish up talking about this and we can take a little break for sure and everybody else can get up and take a break. So this defect that's on the outside of the driver's door or Officer Darren Wilson's vehicle.</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so this door is metal, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Can you describe what that defect appears or looks like to you, not what you concluded it is, but describe it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>For lack of a better term, this is convex, it is coming out of the vehicle. It is not a dent in the vehicle. And it is also, it is hard to tell again what you are seeing up there. It is not a stain that's on the vehicle, you can tell that paint has come off of the  vehicle. Something from the outside or from the inside coming out made that defect to the exterior.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And is there a hole, is there a hole in what you are looking at there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>From the outside of the vehicle?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>From the outside of the car?</p>

          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Okay. Any questions about this. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Is there a hole from the inside looking out?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>There is. Why is it not notated on here?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is not a piece of evidence. It isn't.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The vehicle was taken as a piece of evidence and processed at the crime lab by another detective, but at the scene that's just a visual note that I was taking. It wasn't a piece of evidence that I could collect. Okay. It is notated in your paperwork?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Okay. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Okay. We'll take a break here. Let me check on the timing of your lunch.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>Recess</narrative>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> This is Kathy Alizadeh. It is 11:30, we just took about a ten minute break. Detective is still testifying. Sheila Whirley, she's left the room but everyone else that was present when we began is still present in the room. I want to tell you that your food is scheduled to be here at noon. is just going to knock on the door when the food is here. At that point, I will try to kind of finish up, if he's not done, we're going to get to a part where I can make a logical pause and you will be given your lunch. It might seem like oh, let's go ahead and eat while we are hearing testimony. One, you need a break, I think it is good that you take a little time for lunch, whether it is 30 minutes or an hour, that's up to you. Also, some of these photographs are not going to be things you want to see when you are eating lunch, of course. Ready to get started? Officer , what is your next photograph? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Next photograph is Image Number 63. This is again, what I took an overall photo and what we are going to zoom in on is hand impression that is on the rear of Darren Wilson's police car. This is from east looking west on Canfield. This is my crime scene van at the edge of the crime scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 64, rear of the vehicle, the rear glass of the vehicle. This would be kind of the left side or driver's side of the vehicle on the rear lift gate. Again, it is hard to see from this, not only this photograph but kind of this angle it looks like a couple handprint impressions kind of on the glass. 65. What I did in this image is I moved just to my left a little bit to combat the reflection of the sunlight, daylight that was there to get a better image of what I was seeing in person to describe what this is. It is not a bloody handprint, it is not a muddy handprint, it would be if the window was clean and somebody slapped a wet hand on there and went down a dusty road, all it is is a dust impression of a hand. After I photographed this, almost  immediately a Ferguson officer, I don't know who, came up to me because they noticed me photographing this and were trying to figure out does this apply to the scene? Does it not apply to the scene? I had noticed it and considered I better document it. After I photographed it, somebody came up to me from the department and goes hey, just so you know, Darren was told during roll car to get his car washed because the sergeant saw the handprints on the back window. It was obviously deemed at that point not of evidentiary value to us, but I had already photographed it, so the picture shows what I took.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So had you thought that might have some relevance, you would have maybe tried to lift a print off of there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I would have done a number of things.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>I don't want you to belabor it, you didn't act any further on this handprint because it was told to you it was there earlier in the morning?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. We did nothing other than the three photos that you just saw.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 66, this is just an overall view of the vehicle itself. I think if I remember the time  limit correctly, we were told that the tow truck was close trying to gets its way down Canfield so we can tow the vehicle away. Image 67. Same thing. Just overall image of the vehicle before we were getting ready to tow it. Image 68. Right before this image was taken, my chain of events kind of got scattered. I would have typically have continued photographing the vehicle and then once it was towed I would have taken a picture of where the vehicle was at right after it had been removed. Someone, I'm not sure who, be it family member or someone in the crowd, had tore down some crime scene tape and a few people ran into near the crime scene. The decision was made then that we needed to stop our order of events, how we typically process a scene and we needed to get the body photographed and get the body moved immediately. Typically what you would see in the beginning of the photographs were I had the overall, the intermediate and close-up view of each individual piece of evidence, that got thrown out the window. We not quickly ran down, but we had a  large crowd that had gathered now at the end of the crime scene near Michael Brown. The apartment buildings that you can see on either side, one in the front, there is one obviously behind me where I'm taking this picture. Those were filled with residents on the three stories of the stairwells. There were people on roofs, people had started to line the crime scene from the side not being blocked. What we decided on doing is the medical examiner, I think the fire department that was there had sheets and some tarps that we were going to use because the crowd at this point were starting to chant, kill the police, numerous other derogatory things towards everything about us. And we fully expected another, I don't want to use the term riot, but an outburst once we did uncover the body and begin to move it. We made the decision to use the sheets and tarps the best we could to block the view of everybody that was trying their best to get in the crime scene and see what was going on. Several officers that were there, I would say probably 10 to 15 officers grabbed the body screens, sheets, and tarps, and not just held  them on the ground, but held them up above their heads because the apartment buildings were very close to where we were at. It is hard to really get a perspective from this view how close those buildings were to the scene. We had people on the third floor apartments that could see straight down, and people on roofs that could see straight down. So we had people in close proximity of the perimeter of that body holding screens to try to block us while we're working and still trying to protect the crime scene as well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So this blocking maneuver I'll call it that you did, was this done so that you were hiding some of the things that you were doing or was this done so you could avoid inciting the crowd with what they see when you remove the sheet?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It was strictly done to avoid any type of emotional response that we were expecting to happen when the body was uncovered.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You also refer to the medical examiner being there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It was medical examiner field investigator, not one of the pathologists.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Do you know which one it was?  A</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So after this photograph, and you said that you, it disrupted your normal course of order?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So you can go ahead and talk about the next image.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>69. The first, the previous photo would be the overall view, this would be just the intermediate view of me stepping closer to the body. Again, just kind of drawing your attention to what we are getting ready to photograph. Image 70. This image, obviously, Michael Brown has been uncovered, the sheets have been moved from here to this end of the body, you can see now people's feet, which I would typically just out of habit try to keep people out of my photographs, but again, I'm standing in between policemen now, kind of my back against, with the scene secured and kind of collapsed down on top of us to shield the public's eye.

        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Can you turn it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, I'm sorry. Just like I would normally do at the beginning of the scene taking overall views from all the way around what I'm  trying to show you. I do the same thing with a victim or Michael Brown. So before I was standing over here on the right side of the picture looking this way, now I'm looking at his feet, I'm standing on the eastern end looking to the west. Image 72. Same thing, the previous image I was standing probably on the double yellow line, now I've moved slightly to the south and again you can see the feet of the policemen that are standing around holding the screens. Image 73. I'm on the south side of the street looking north and again just kind of an overall intermediate view. This picture in particular you can see that I cut off part of his foot in the photograph.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You mean out of the frame of the photograph?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Out of frame, I did not cut part of his foot off. In the photograph his foot is out of the frame.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You see the white sheet is still above his head?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. Image 74. Corrected the previous photo by including his entire foot in the frame.  Image 75. An overall view, again, I put in the center of the overall view kind of where I'm going with the next information so this would be in our processing of the scene. We do as many face shots and identification shots as the body is found.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, when you are processing a death scene, is it common place when you first see the body and document it that there might be evidence of medical intervention, people that might have been to a scene and tried to provide medical aid to a victim?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, anything from people being intubated with a breathing device, to clothes being removed for CPR purposes, to just the simple EKG type of devices attached to the feet to check to see if there is a heartbeat.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>In your experience in those circumstances that when there is some type of medical intervention, when the medical personnel are done, they leave those devices at the scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They do, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did you see any evidence of medical intervention?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And his clothes didn't appear to have been  cut off or in any way moved or removed that you could see where there would be leads placed on his body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 76. Intermediate view Michael Brown's shoulders and face. Image 77. This would be the close-up view. Image 78. Again, an overall view and in the center of the screen I see his right hand and injury defect to it. Image 79, what I would determine an intermediate view of his right hand and the defect. Image 80. Moving farther up the right arm, that would be a defect injury to his right forearm. Image 81. This would be kind of moving back again, as far as my perspective because I'm starting to show the tattoo and injury to the inside part of his right arm. Image 82, image of the defect to the inside of his right arm, all of these series of photos I'm showing you. It is the body as it is uncovered to me. He has not been moved, manipulated  with me or by any of the medical examiner investigators. Image 83. Photo of right arm again showing visible tattoos that we can use for a positive identification. If we have family members that are there that can say oh, yeah, he has a tattoo of this on his arm or this on his leg, stuff they told us to look for that we can use for identification purposes. Image Number 84 . Overall view and what we're looking at here is tattoo on his left arm. Image Number 85. Tattoo on the inside of his left arm. Image Number 86. This would be a view of Michael Brown's back. This is a standard photograph that we take as part of every death investigation, be it an overdose or child death or anything else, we always show lack of injury as well. So this is the medical examiner investigator lifted up the back of his shirt just to show no injuries were present there. Image 87. This image is showing an overall view specifically as to the location of Michael Brown's left hand. These are again a set of  images that were requested by the detectives after they had spoken with Darren Wilson and we kind of had a brief, we had his first initial statement they requested these photos as part of his statement. He had said that Michael Brown had come back towards his direction with a hand stuck into his waist band, as if --</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Don't speculate about what as if, this was information that you got, not directly, from an officer?</p>

          <p>A detective that had spoken with him that was now back at the scene giving us things to look for.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>This is the reason for the photograph, you are not drawing any conclusions or assumptions from that information, correct?</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, in this photograph you can see yellow lines that are around his extremities?</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>What's that for?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>As part of any scene, we talked about the  diagram that you guys have the placards are always left in place even after we collect the evidence. The last thing we do is diagram the scene part of the diagramming of any death scene is where the body position was. Everyone has seen the old fashion silhouette still laying on the ground, those are paper and they move, particularly outdoor scenes. We take chalk and we outline the location of the feet, hands and head where we have those permanent chalk marks, not permanent, but chalk marks on the ground while we were there to measure his location from after he is removed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">

        </speech>

          <p>It is a lot of protocol from many departments is the officer that is involved typically leaves almost immediately once they are able to.</p>

          <p>Image Number 88. Intermediate view of the location of his left hand and arm, or the position.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh that's not your chalk mark, is it?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, that's the inside, that's the yellow dividing line for the road. There should be a chalk mark that we can kind of see here denoting where his hand is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 89. Outside of his shirt being lifted up in the back by the medical examiner investigator, this is the first time Michael Brown had been moved. He was rolled onto his right shoulder, again, showing the positioning of his left arm.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And you were there when the medical examiner rolled him onto his shoulder?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Are you familiar with what rigor mortis  is?</p>

          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did you, do you believe that rigor mortis had set in on the body of Michael Brown at this point?</p>

          <p> Medical investigator.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh investigator turned him over, did his limbs stay in the positions that they were when he was on his front?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They did, and you can see that not only from the position of his arm, his leg is still up and his head is not moved down.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So this is hand?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I believe, is the blue glove.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The white glove is an employee of the St. Louis Delivery Service, which is the company the medical examiner's office uses to transport Michael Brown.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So is this officer trying to place his arm in a particular position by, in this photograph or is that the way his arm was when he was rolled over? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>His arm stayed in that position from the time he was rolled over until the time we rolled him over onto his back.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 90. Previous to overall, this would be an intermediate, again, showing the position of his left hand.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And you did not witness anyone manipulate that in any way did you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, other than just rolling him onto his right shoulder.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> His hand, it seems like it is balled up, this is Sheila Whirley, there was nothing in his hand though?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Not that I saw at the scene, no.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay. And you would have noted if there was something in his hand?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Typically, yes. The body itself belongs to the medical examiner. What we investigate on the body at the scene is very minimal compared to what they do at autopsies. If there was a knife sticking out of his hand, something that is protruding, I would have been able to see that and document that if there was something clenched inside of his hand, that is not something that we would pry his hand  open to see at the scene, that would be something that is done after the body arrives at the morgue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> I understand if there was a weapon in his hand, you would have seen it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> And there was not?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No. Image 91. Michael Brown is now rolled completely over onto his back. Again, you'll see the overall photos of me walking kind of a 360 degree area around the body. The sheet that he's laying on is not one of the sheets he was covered up with, this is a new sheet, and lack of a better term, body bag brought in by the medical examiner.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh this blue thing right here?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>You will see that in, a couple of the images, that is a handle for the bag to pick him up, it is to assist in carrying people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. Would the old sheet that we was on, would this have been collected as evidence as well?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I was asked that yesterday. I did not collect it, I can't say with certainty, but I am  assuming those type of things typically go into the body bag and go to the morgue. Image 92. Overall view of the previous one was from like his feet looking towards his head, this side view. Again, better image of that blue material you see was a handle for the body bag. Image 93.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I'm sorry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>No, the other way, you're not on, turn it around, there you go?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Okay. Again 360 degree view from his head looking towards his feet. Again, you can kind of get perspective now the policemen that we had blocking the scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You see those weighted sand bags along here for the body screen?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, just like we saw in the previous images at the beginning of my photos where that weight was kind of left in the middle of the street.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Do you know what this is right here?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I think that's another sheet that had been used to cover him or part of it. There was more than one sheet that had been used to cover him up. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>94.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Can you turn it, the other way, there we go.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> That means your food is here. So maybe we'll try to finish with the images of the body at the scene, six?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Five more.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> And break for lunch, is that all right with everybody?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Again, just overall view of the body, kind of the exact same position. This may be one of those things where my camera clicked twice. I know at this point there is some items sitting on his stomach, this is where the investigator from the medical examiner's office had removed some items from his pocket to show what he had in his pockets there.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh scene that do you ever go inside the pockets of the deceased person?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, again, in the State of Missouri the deceased body belongs to the medical examiner's office in St. Louis County or to the coroner in different counties, however they are titled. Body  belongs to them, that includes stuff that's in their pockets, their clothing, everything. We, myself personally, never touch a body physically unless I'm at the autopsy and I'm fingerprinting the deceased or anything like that. But as far as searching of the body, that is strictly done by the medical examiner investigator.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Were you present when the investigator searched the body of Michael Brown?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did you see him remove items from his pockets?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did you see him place the items on, I guess, I would say the belly of Michael Brown?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is that something that's typically done that the items were placed on the deceased body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Given space and time, they are either placed on the body or if it is a large amount of things they would be placed directly next to him where I would photograph him and those items are just returned back into the pockets of the deceased.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 95. Again, identification purpose  photos, he's now been rolled over the other side of the face is what I photographed before because this was the size that was down against the pavement. So now I'm taking my overall intermediate views of the side of the scene. Image 96. Intermediate view of Michael Brown's face. Image 97. Just like on his arms in the previous photos where I did the overall intermediate close-up views of any visible defects or injuries. This is close-up view of a visible defect and injury to his face.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, can you tell me what portion, I mean, the bridge of his nose?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The bridge of his nose, this would be his left eye.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And you're standing above his head?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Directly above him pointing my camera straight down. Image 98. Intermediate view of items removed from his pocket by And Image 99 would just be a close-up view of those items.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, did you seize those items?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>No, ma'am, I did not. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And that's because you said these items belong to the medical examiner's office because they were on the body?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Let me stop here. The items that were photographed on Michael Brown, did you observe put those items back in the pockets?</p>

        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> So we'll stop right now for you guys to have lunch, okay. I would just, I'm going to take the photographs that we haven't discussed with me, these I'm going to leave here. Do what you will, but these have already been, you know, looked at by you. I would suggest that you just have a lunch and not go over any of this stuff, but if you desire to do so, they are here, okay? And let you take that. And it is 12:33 approximately, and we will break for lunch. Why don't you guys let  know.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> It is 12:05 p.m.</p>

          <p> Okay, sorry about that.</p>

        <narrative>Recess</narrative>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh Detective this is a continuation of your testimony from this morning.</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So you are still under oath, you understand?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so we're going to resume again with the remainder of the photographs that you took during your investigation of the crime scene. So you can resume with the next photograph?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image Number 100. This is a standard photo that we take during any death investigation photograph of where the body was after it had been removed by medical examiner personnel. What you can start to see in this photograph are again the chalk markings we put in place while the body was still there for our measurement points. Also you can see an evidence placard here again, once we collect evidence, the  placard is left in place for us to measure and diagram from later.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now at this point, have you collected all of the evidence?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>At that point we had collected everything that we had found. I had mentioned before in an ideal world you see the overall, intermediate and close-up view of each individual piece of evidence. The shell casings, projectiles and some other items of evidence that were around the body in the chaos of the gunshots being fired near us, people tearing down our crime scene tape and coming in, those shots were missed, the photographs, the images, I'm sorry, were not taken prior to us picking up those items of evidence. We got them out of there to protect those pieces of evidence and just didn't get photographs of them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>But you did document them in your diagram, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. The last photo, the previous one that was up there you can see the evidence placard is still there. You will see it in some of the following photos too, you will see the yellow evidence placard still in place. Item of evidence won't be sitting in  front of it, but the placard is still where the item was located for measurement purposes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, something that we talked about this morning, and you and I had a brief conversation out there about something that you recalled, I asked you earlier when you were photographing the body of Michael Brown up close and going to start moving the body, uncovering it and moving it, you had officers that were shielding you with sheets and tarps?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And the body screens that you call them?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>I had asked you if that was done to conceal what you were doing from public view and so that people wouldn't see what you were doing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And you had described that's not the purpose for why you were being shielded, was there any civilians who were allowed inside that shielded area once you uncovered the body of Michael Brown?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, after we had put the shields up, the tarps and the sheets to block the outside people looking in from above our vantage point, Michael Brown's father, Michael Brown, Senior was allowed inside the crime scene and actually inside the group  of tarps to witness and observe what we were doing. That served multiple purposes, primarily to provide positive identification. Would be no different from any other homicide scene where we would have a family member provide us with identification once we do go in and uncover the body and everything else, just like the photographs that I showed you of the tattoos on his arms, those were things that the family told us to look for when identifying him, but it served no other purpose than letting him observe what we were doing and give us positive identification of his son.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>He wasn't allowed to touch anything in that inner circle as you called it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, he stayed basically on the inner perimeter that we had created.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did he positively identify the body in the street as his son?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Not to me personally, but to the detective he was with, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Did he remain in that perimeter for the duration of the time that Michael Brown's body was on the street?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And after he was removed by the delivery  personnel, did he then leave the scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>He did, left the inner perimeter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Right, okay, you can continue with the next photograph.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image Number 101. Same thing as before showing the 360 degree views of what we're looking at. Again, chalk marks on the ground that are labeled right foot, left foot, see the chalk marking there for the right hand and here for the left hand. Image 102. Same thing as before, north side of the street looking south again, feet and hand chalk markings. A couple things you can see in this photograph are number one, a pile of blue tarps on this side. Those are some of the tarps that we used to shield the view of the public that was around us. Wrapped up in there are some white sheets that were used as well to shield the views, not the ones that I know of that were used to cover the body. Also things that you see in this video here are, image right here is a box that we use to hold our placards and a large 250 foot yellow measuring tape. Just things we were getting ready to do the diagram of the scene. Also you can see in this photo these  placards over here next to the different cones, those are placards that again don't have any intermediate or close-up views of the evidence item that they were marking the other side, the placards were left in place for diagram purposes. Image 103. Same angle as before, just an intermediate view of the chalk marks and where Michael Brown's body and everything. It is hard to tell, that is an initial for RH, the right hand. Officer all of the casings were retrieved?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, I'll show you the rest of them when we get towards the end. Number 104. Close-up view. Again, in the actual photograph it shows that is an R and that is an H, just denoting our chalk mark of which body part is shown. Image 105. Again, chalk marks for the bottom and the feet, LF left foot, RF for right foot. Image 106. Closer image of the same left foot and right foot chalk marks.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh and again, it is not as clear up on the screen, but  we talked about yesterday that, for example, what is that thing right there?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Oh, you will see this in a couple other ones, that is a cigarette butt. On the street in a couple images that you will see and a couple more slides, you will see other cigarette butts within the scene. Those were deemed as not evidentiary, they were cigarette butts and trash that litter this entire street. Some scenes, obviously, those are important DNA evidence, this scene there is no part of the case up and even to this point where at the scene we knew or thought that a cigarette butt had anything to do with the incident.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So you didn't collect any cigarette butts?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>They were just there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They were left at the scene. Were there any droppings between the officer's car and the body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>What type of dropping? Blood droppings?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh </narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No. I walked from my crime scene van to where the body was that day no less than 50 times. Along with the other three detectives, my detective sergeant and countless other crimes against person homicide detectives, and no one saw any, no one noticed any, we looked, nothing was ever found between the officer's car and where Michael Brown was. What's the distance between the police car, the officer's car and the body, do you know?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>153 feet 9 inches. It is noted on your diagram. If you look on your diagram.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Page two of your diagram.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Page one.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> All right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is noted in the drawing you will see the bottom line on Canfield and you will see the number 152 feet 9 inches noted in there, that is the distance between the driver's front wheel of Darren Wilson's police car and Michael Brown's head location. That's the distance between the two. And that measurement was taken specifically from a baseline measurement of where Michael Brown's head was located when we marked it and where we marked,  chalk marked the officer's tire of his car, that's how we came up with that. The position that you find Mr. Brown face down?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. Was looking to the police car?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. Thank you.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Sure. Image 107. 107, again another overall view. Overall picture of the chalk mark where the left hand was at. Again, another evidence placard here with no evidence next to it, just marking the location of where it was collected. Image Number 108. Close-up view that is an L, that is an H with an indicator line and this is the position of his left hand again, cigarette butt that was left at the scene, just happen to be in this image. Image 109. Just so I can figure out where I'm at. At this point in the investigation another crime scene detective had seized Darren Wilson's firearm. Up to this point we had no idea of knowing how many rounds he had fired. We were given the number and the number we had recovered at  the scene did not match the number that were missing from his gun.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh there.</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>His weapon was seized and we will hear testimony by other officers, you were told that his weapon was seized and that it was checked to see how many, you're familiar with his weapon?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And it is?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>A Sig Sauer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>It is a semiautomatic?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>It is the type of weapons that ejects casings when fired?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>It is the type of weapon that has a magazine that holds ammunition that goes into the handle of the gun?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And were you told how many, do you know how many rounds that gun will carry?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They vary by model. I was told that their duty weapons that he used in this incident carries  13 rounds total.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And that would be how many in a magazine?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Twelve in a magazine and one in the chamber.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>In order to have a bullet in the chamber, an officer has to have loaded the magazine, rack the bullet into the chamber, remove the magazine and put in one more bullet in his gun?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, that's correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>That's fully loaded and one is ready in the chamber?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That is it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is that how you instructed your charges when you are doing instructions at the range?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, exactly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So that doesn't mean that somebody is out to shoot somebody, that is just how you were to have your gun fully loaded and ready to go?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, that's how you go to work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so you were told how many live rounds were left in officer, in his gun?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>One live round.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so that would leave 12 rounds possibly fired?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And were you told that Officer Wilson had indicated that before this incident occurred, he had loaded his weapon and it was fully loaded?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>At this point in the investigation, how many shell casings had you recovered?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>At this point we recovered ten shell casings.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We were looking for two.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And had you also been told now, initially would you have planned to process the inside of that car while you were at the scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Your intention was to have the car towed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And it would be in a garage?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Away from the elements?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>And our crime lab in a secure facility to process the inside.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Were you told at some point that possibly his gun was fired while he was inside the vehicle?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so now getting back to where you said  you were interrupted what you had been doing, what event had transpired?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>At this point after the body had moved, we had learned the information of how many rounds he had fired, which were 12. We had found ten shell casings and we were continuing to look at the eastern end of the crime scene where the body was at. We were looking around the western end where the vehicle was at, unknown how many shots were fired at which location. The vehicle was getting ready to be towed and to save us time spent here closing down this entire apartment complex, we were trying to determine if possibly the shell casings were inside of his police car because we hadn't been in to search it yet because we had made the determination to tow it and process it at our lab, but that could take a couple of hours from start to finish. In the meantime we could be searching for two casings that just left our crime scene. So I talked with the detective that was going to process his car and we, not quickly, but we briefly opened the door where I photographed the hole that corresponds with the dent on the outside of the door and then we went through just  looking under chairs, looking in the cracks of seats, Darren Wilson's duty bag was in his passenger seat, we looked through it and I have photographs of all of that just showing what we took out of that car. And not processing it for DNA, fingerprints and stuff like that. We were just simply searching for potentially two spent shell casings that we can't account for anywhere else at the scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So the next series of photographs show that part of your investigation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. You can go ahead and continue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Photo 110. Overall view of the driver's side of the vehicle. Number 111. Intermediate view driver's side front door.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>From your earlier testimony we know that the window is not up on the driver's side door?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>At this point, we can obviously look into the vehicle.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>But the window was not there, it wasn't halfway up or it wasn't up at all, it just was not  there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Number 112. Video of the driver's side door open. This is just kind of showing our process, the outside door closed, now it is open. Image 113. Same angle, just a different orientation of the camera. Interior door panel.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What number is this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I'm sorry. Image 114, interior door panel. Overall view and again, you can see the placard is still on the ground there where evidence item two was at. What we're looking on this overall view of the interior of the driver's door. Image 115. Close-up intermediate view of circular defect to the inside panel of the driver door.</p>
        </speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I was simply documenting what we found on the inside. Image 116. Just overall interior view again, now you can start to see this is pieces of broken glass, it is safety glass, most cars you see when it breaks, it doesn't break in big shards, small pieces of glass. Image 117. A view of the upper part of the driver's seat. You can tell in this scene or in this picture that this is what is referred to as a cage car, metal cage is in the back seat where it prohibits these seats from being laid back basically or scooted back farther than this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is this barrier a cage or plexiglass?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Plexiglass, the top half is glass, you can see here it is metal from here down to the floor.</p>

        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So when you enter the vehicle, is this a sliding little window?</p>

          <p>You don't recall if it was open or closed  and you didn't process it for that reason?</p>

          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Did you look in the back seat?</p>

          <p>I did not.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>For shell casings?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We did open the doors and look, we didn't see anything.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. For the purposes of speeding this through, did you find any shell casings inside the car?</p>

          <p>No, ma'am.</p>

        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So these next series of photos, we will have somebody who processed the inside of the car who is going to talk about what he found inside the car, but this is just you documenting what you saw in the car?</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>

          <p>So we can do these a little quicker.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>118. Again, overall view from the driver's side. Image 119 is an overall view from the passenger side of the vehicle. Again, evidence  marker where the bracelet was at is still in place and this is showing Darren Wilson's duty bag or gear bag and his rain coat. Image 120. Darren Wilson's gear bag in the passenger seat. We are showing it because the rain coat and the gear bag were removed prior to the towing of the vehicle and given back to Ferguson Police Department.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Sheila Whirley speaking, you mention duty bag and gear bag, are these the same thing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Synonymous terms, it is a bag that every policeman carries with him that has paperwork, forms, your lunch, your rain coat.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Is this something that you looked inside?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We expanded it just, and looked to the bottom of the bag to see if a shell casing had fallen inside.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> You didn't do a thorough search of it or anything?</p>

          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Number 121. Photo looking down into his gear bag. </p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh what this thing is here?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It appears to me to be a wood baton.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>That's something that some police officers carry?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. Image 122. The gear bag has been taken out of the seat and when it focuses in now, I'm just showing the rain coat or traffic coat lying in the floorboard. Most of these coats are reversible. Image 123. The inside would be the bright yellow or traffic yellow color, you can turn that outside when you are directing traffic in the rain and inside, obviously, the exterior and that was removed, that was the last photo of his car. Now, we're moving back to the eastern part of the crime scene. Image 124. Okay. I'll ask you to look at the diagram on page one so you can get a reference to where this is. On the far right-hand side you see two evidence bubbles labeled 19 and 20. If you look at the top part of this photo, I don't know if it is blocked by the camera, you can see a large red stain here in the middle of the road, that was the location of Michael Brown's head. Farther up the road here would be Darren  Wilson's car. So we are standing at the eastern end looking west. What these other items are, are two blood spatter patterns that are located farther east of Michael Brown's body on the ground. Image 125.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, let me not correct you, but clarify, you said blood?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You didn't test it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I did not test it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So it is called red stains?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Somebody else will testify about what it was?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is a red stain similar to a spatter pattern that I would recognize as needing to be documented and possibly important to the case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You've seen crime scenes before where there are blood trails or blood spatter, and you know that sometimes those spatters can give you some information about what was going on when that blood was dropped onto that surface?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, I've seen it in several crime scenes. I've taken several classes on recognizing, interpreting and the correct way to document these  things. I am not a certified expert and I would never claim to be in pattern analyst.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So you recognize that these actual, what you call blood spatters, we think they are blood spatters at this point?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>That they needed to be documented?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>So this would be an intermediate view of 19. I know the other picture isn't readily available to give you an orientation, the point of this placard is pointed west down Canfield, if that makes sense. So the stain was nearer his head?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No. So just the opposite?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Just the opposite. Can I ask one question. You talked earlier about a break in the investigation due to additional gun fire; is that right?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Is that by citizens or  police?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It was not by the police. Not by the police.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We don't know who it was. That wasn't in the crime scene at all?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, it was from where I was standing, which in your diagram would be the building, the building on the south side of the road of it sounded like it came from directly behind that building. So there is no way that this could have been part of this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We had already identified, located this spatter prior to the second round of gunshots. Image 126. Intermediate view of the spatter pattern and clarifying this end of this pattern would be closest to Michael Brown, this would be the farthest part.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh is in between the blood spatter and Darren Wilson's vehicle?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So blood spatter is farther east from the body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. These two spatter patterns are the farthest east evidence that we located.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 127. Same thing, directly overhead view with additional scale laid in for analysis purposes. Image 128. At this point I think this would be an intermediate view of the same spatter pattern. Again, with more than one scale to assist experts in size and shape. Image 129. Similar photos before, different orientation of the camera.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so the placard and that scale?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Has not moved since the previous photo. Basically the photo before, if you can picture I'm standing facing directly west, now I've oriented myself where I'm facing south and the placards are still in the same direction. Image Number 130. At this point I have switched camera lenses to what we will refer to as a prime lens. The lens I typically use for overall photos is 18 to 35, kind of a wide angle lens. I switched to a 60 millimeter lens, which is  a fixed focal. It is something where you can get close-up images of something with great detail. It doesn't zoom in or zoom out, it only focuses at fixed length. It can focus in really close to small objects to find greater detail.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And although you can't see the placard clearly, that's number 19?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, still number 19.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 131. Again, the overhead projector isn't showing a lot of detail, but this is just a close-up image of number 19 still, and I'm focusing on the scale to show, an analyst would describe as a tail of the red spatter pattern.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And that's also 19?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Still 19, yes, ma'am. Image Number 132. Now we've moved back to image, I would have to go back to the overall one first, number 20 is an overall position.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You want to look at your diagram?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I need to see the overall of the two placards together. Number 20, in the overall. Can I put this back up?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Sure, but say the photo number.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I'm going to put Image Number 124 back up  just to show you the orientation of the placard. Again, the corner arm of the placard is facing back towards Michael Brown's body and Darren Wilson's police car. Now, going to Image 132, so this pointer arm of the placard is facing west. I'm standing on the north side of the road looking south to take this photograph. Image 133. Intermediate view again. The placard is facing west again looking at this red stain pattern. Image 134. Again, evidence item number 20, red stain pattern still standing on the north side of it looking south. Image 135. Same perspective, I've now added a second scale to reference size and shape. Image 136. Again, here I switched back again to my macro lens or my prime lens to show up close and with greater detail the tailing pattern of the spatter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And that's item number 20?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Still item number 20, yes. Image 137. Still on evidence item number 20. Again, another photo, same reference as before.  Image 138. Still evidence item 20, yet closer view of a tail. Image 139. Scale in the previous photo, this scale was referenced this direction. I moved the placard out of the way and referenced this scale to the bottom of it to give you a reference point. This is on the, this is the eastern end, this up would be the north, I'm sorry, to the west back towards Michael Brown's body.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. Now, regarding these two red stains, 19 and 20, did you seize them and package them?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, I seized a sample of them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Was it in a similar, same method that you described seizing the red stain on the side of the vehicle?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Sterile Q-Tip with sterile water and then put into its own individual packaging box.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And those are still labeled items number 19 and 20?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, sample of item 19 and 20.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So in this case, you didn't consume the whole stain?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, it would be enough to fill a  Q-Tip.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And you know you don't need more than a small amount for testing purposes?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Image Number 140. Basically this is a photograph showing how I have reorientated the scale that you saw in the previous picture. This way, I'm sorry, again you can see the placard for 19, which is this other splatter pattern, and 18 is a placard for a piece of evidence that had already been collected, but the placard is still in place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Item Number 18 would have been listed on your diagram as to what that was?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, I believe item 18 was another spent Federal shell casing. Image 141. Same thing as before, it is another image showing how I moved the orientation of that scale reference item 20. Image 142. Just like with the previous scale of photos, I go from my intermediate, my overall, to my intermediate, again, this would be the intermediate showing the new reference point or orientation of the scale. Item 143. This is a photograph, again, I had switched to my macro lens and took the  photograph with the scale below, the photograph here. It did not show up in the frame.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And this is item 20 still?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, still item number 20. Image 144. The same shot as before with the scale in the frame. Image 145. This image shows several things. This is the overall image of evidence items 21 and 22, which we found and you will see in the next few photographs, the final two shell casings to get to 12 shell casings. The first thing you will see in this image number one is the Ferguson car is still here, we have pushed the crime scene back at this point in time. Here again is the pile of tarps and sheets that we used to shield the view of the public. You can also see these are evidence placards for 11 and 12. Those are other shell casings that we found previously and had already collected. This is the end of our, towards the end of my investigation here for physical evidence and it shows that we never stop in the order that we find them. Obviously, 11 and 12 wouldn't necessarily be next to 21 and 22, with 15 being over here. It is just the order we found it at. The  very end of the crime scene we finally focused the time finding those last two shell casings we found them over here in the grass.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So just because it is not clear on the overhead, what is that one?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That is the placard for evidence item 11.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And that is?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Twelve.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Is this a placard?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What is it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That is 22.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What's this one?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That's 21 is the farther one away. We found 21 first and then continued looking and we found 22 closer this way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Or closer to the west. Image 146. Almost identical to the previous photo, just kind of an intermediate view. 147. Intermediate view of the placard for 22. 148. Same thing, intermediate view of the placard. Image 149. You can see this is a  close-up view still of the placard number 22 and if you can see, which is hard to do, this round object here, that is the very opening of the spent shell casing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>It is easier to see on the photo?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is a lot easier to see in the photograph, and it can also show when they are sitting straight up like that, impossible to see with the naked eye.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>How is it that they found this?</p>

          <p>Projectile would be the term of the bullet that is fired from a shell casing, the piece of a cartridge that comes out of the firearm that would be the projectile.</p>

          <p>Something I would refer to as a parent projectile.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Was that one of the items that you had to collect primarily, you had a chance to do a close-up and intermediate photograph?</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is item number 17, and in your diagram it is the north side of Michael Brown's right foot on the ground next to him where you see the number  seven, the small bubble that says 17, what I collected as an apparent projectile.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Someone you also conveyed that as well as the samples of the stains, 19 and 20 and number eight and number nine, those all went to a lab for somebody else to analyze, correct?</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>

          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And again, other than crawling on your hands and knees, you ever like get metal detectors out there and try to recover projectiles?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Every crime scene van is equipped with a metal detector. They're primarily used for finding shell casings and heavily grass areas or other pieces of metal evidence. We have used them before to look for projectiles, we understand that when a bullet is fired, a projectile doesn't stop necessarily for a lot of things, including the earth. Where we would see what looks like a bullet may have skipped into grass and you would swear it has to be there. It could have skipped and gone up and farther away, or if it is fired into the  ground, it is going to be so deep, it would take a lot of manpower and/or just work to get it out and not guarantee that you will actually be able to recover it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>I guess for the sake of understanding this, when shell casings are ejected, you know they travel in a predictable direction and somewhat in a perimeter that doesn't go beyond a certain area, like you are not going to look in the next block for a shell casing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, not for a shell casing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Right. They tend to be somewhere closer to the crime scene or to the point where they were ejected from the gun, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>But projectiles, would it be safe to say, that could be two blocks away?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>And then some, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. You may continue. In this regard, did you search the rest of the area, including buildings and trees and objects to determine if you could find a projectile that might have become embedded in something?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This next set of photos, yes, we searched one spot. </p>

          <p>Image 154. This is the front building of Canfield, which if you want to look at your diagram, it would be the building on the southeast part of the crime scene. I would be close to where the orientation of this, if you look at this window here, this window right here is where we were eventually heading to in this photo sequence. To reference where we're at, straight out here into the middle of the street is where Michael Brown's body had been to orient you where this photo was taken. Photos 155. Close-up view of the address plate. 156. Is a closer up view. Image 157. Again, this part of the building right here is where I just took the image of the plate and now we are looking down here at this window in particular. Did you say that apartment is due north of where Michael Brown's body was found?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">

        </speech>

          <p>We put that in two spots. That's what accident reconstructionists do when we draw these, we are not accident reconstructionists. Okay.</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Image 158. Intermediate view of that apartment window, and what we are looking at here is a defect into the siding. Image 159. Same window, same defect. Image 160. Just a close-up view of this defect. At this point in the investigation, we recovered all the shell casings, the spent shell casings and the number, the 12 that we needed to account for. This was a defect that was brought to our attention by a witness that from what I can testify to wasn't there when the shooting occurred, but lived in this building and brought this to our attention. I think there is a bullet hole in our siding. So we go up to look at it after this  photo was taken. I took out about a 6 foot section of her siding and the insulation that's on it. Behind it is three quarter inch of plywood and then in between the plywood there's about a 4 inch gap and goes into solid concrete cinder block wall. I could see inside of it that whatever that was that caused that hole was not sitting behind there and this was above the window and it was open behind there. To continue to look for apparent projectile that might be in there I would have to remove that siding all the way around to that window, the plywood all the way around and cause significant damage to that apartment building. Again, without guaranteeing any hope of actually finding something because I've done this more than once into just a drywall piece where you see this and you take it all out and realize that it just caused that hole and skipped off somewhere. I've also seen where things have gone through something like that three or four layers of wood, hit something concrete, you get it, it just looks like a penny and it just smashed. And the firearms ballistic expert will testify that sometimes bullets get mangled to  the point you can't confer anything from this then. So we made the decision at that point, after I had removed the siding to not do any more damage to this lady's outside of her apartment.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh know that that was even made by a bullet?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, no.</p>

        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Could be a woodpecker?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Anything. You can tell it is not exactly a round defect, which is something you typical see with a firearm. Not to say that a firearm couldn't do that, but it could have been anything. There was no guarantee or eye witness that said I was standing here when this happened and this is brand new damage. This, in fact, we walked around that immediate apartment complex and found a few other damages and defects to siding that had cobwebs on this and could tell they had been weathered or old from the time we were there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You did search the surrounding areas and you were not able to find any other apparent bullet holes and no other projectiles?</p>

          <p>No, ma'am.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Final photos is Image 161. I explained at the beginning this would be the first and last photos that we take in our memory cards for our photo technicians when they look at our files to know what the beginning and ending of the scene is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right. I have two other areas to cover very quickly. Going back to Grand Jury Exhibit 2, this is your diagram. So you've already testified that one of the last things, let me ask you this, after you've done the photographs and seized all the evidence that you described, what's the next thing you do?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Now we start diagramming.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Photograph our evidence, selected our evidence, accounted for every piece of evidence that we know of at the time. The body has been moved, cars have been towed, we go back now to diagram the scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right. Now, on Grand Jury Exhibit Number 2, is this the diagram you made of this scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>And so we referenced this before, you have here not to scale? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>What does that mean, not to scale?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The items in this photo that are not to scale would be obviously number one, the size and shape of these apartment buildings, we have them just as plain rectangles. The size and shape of the width of the road as compared to the size of the vehicle. If you look as far as scale drawings go, this vehicle is the same size as Michael Brown here. Those things are hard to do with the software we're given and the tools that we use as crime scene detectives to draw into scale on a CAD type drawing. Also the size of this entry point on Caddiefield, the driveway is not the same size as this one. They may be in real life, but whether we measure to scale or measure for our plotting purposes of evidence, we don't measure those types of measurement. You can see down here in the lower baseline starting at 0.0 feet. How we do the diagrams is I took a long screwdriver and at the corner where Copper Creek Court comes into Canfield, I drove a screwdriver down into the dirt and hooked my 250  foot measuring tape and 0.0 there. Then from the edge of the road from Canfield, run from 0.0, we run that tape measure out as far past our last piece of evidence that we need to. If you look on page two of the diagram, it has the measurements and lists of evidence that was collected. How this is measured and the reason why we do this diagram is one, to kind of show a visual picture of the scene, but two, if we ever needed to go back and put evidence back in place, we can easily go back and do that with very little effort. As basic as it is, if you look, I'll use evidence item number 19 I believe is the farthest one away, you will start at 0.0 and the your first measurement you will see is listed as.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You all have your diagrams and probably easier to look at the overhead.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>So I will use evidence item number 18 as my example, or 19, it is even number. If you look on the diagram, evidence item number 19 is the bubble here that is farthest to the east. The first column of measurements shows baseline west from Copper Creek, so if you look at the baseline measurement here and walked  west 31 feet and stopped, in the second column of measurements shows 11 feet 9 inches south of the baseline. So if you measured 31 feet west, 11 feet 9 inches south, that spot right there is where evidence item 19 is at. You do that for every piece of evidence, even down here the ones, the shell casings we found in the grassy area, evidence item 22, you are 47 feet 4 inches west of the baseline and then 31 feet 3 inches south and you'd find the exact spot where that evidence item was placed. The measurements, we did those intersecting measurements for items number 1 through 22.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Let me stop you. Do those include items like eight and nine, which I think were on the vehicle?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes. If you will notice eight and nine do not have measurements on them because those were found on the police vehicle on the driver's side door. So in the second section of marked, it is labeled Ferguson Marked Police Vehicle Number 108, you will find the measurements for the location of each of the four tires from the west baseline and south of baseline measurements. And from there we  could --</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>You could put the car back?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We could put the car back where it was at and show you by photographs where those red stains were located. The same for Michael Brown's location, the same exact technique for west from 0.0 baseline, and south left foot and right foot, left hand, right hand and head, and then on the bottom it has a sentence that states again, the baseline runs east to west on north side of Canfield Road, which 0 feet 0 inches stops and Copper Creek Court. That's how we do diagramming situations. So to label this not to scale is because these things, if you blew it up to life size, this might not be 153 feet or 152 feet 9 inches. To show you the reason why we put that on there is to give you the scale of this size of thing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>So just to clarify though, that distance that is between that you already testified about and it is blurry here, but the distance from this point to this point?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That measurement is from the driver's side front tire of Darren Wilson's police car to the head of Michael Brown. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>All right. And you said if you blew it up, it might not be 100, whatever that number is?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>As far as to scale and size.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>But that actually is the distance actually between those two items?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. So the diagram isn't to scale, but the measurements are exact?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The measurements are to scale, but the diagram is not drawn to measurement scale.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Does anybody have any questions about the photographs or the diagram? Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh this witness and this will probably be less than five minutes, unless Sheila can think of other questions.

          <p>Chevy SUV. I'm not sure if it was a Suburban or a Tahoe. All right, thanks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Just real quickly. There was another part of your investigation you did another video from a perspective and that was because you were told somebody saw something from a particular window; is that correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, I did one and I know another detective that was at the scene did other ones. The one I did as far as where, I can't remember the address, it is on the evidence receipt, they had us go to different eyewitness perspectives just to stand there and video similar to this. There is not narration in it, it simply is a video, me standing, or whoever the camera operator was at the time,  standing where the witness states they were standing and observed whatever it was they observed. Again, there is not a narrative stating they saw this, they were seeing this and my particular video I know that I stood at the section where the witness stated she saw what was going on. I attempted to use our video camera to zoom in across the parking lot where she was saying she could see everything happening. My camera would only focus on the screen part of the door. It was through a sliding patio door, it would only focus on the screen no matter how much I would zoom in, it wouldn't show the scene from her perspective. I zoomed back, you had to step to the left and then zoomed in again to show the distance where she was seeing things and kind of give you a reference point because at the time when I did my witness perspective video, it was after we had picked everything up. It was the last thing, a witness had come forward at the very end and said hey, I think I saw this from here. The detective interviewed and asked to go down and shoot a witness perspective from her standpoint.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> You will see that video  later, but I would rather show that to you in conjunction with that witness testimony so it will be easier for you to kind of tie those together, but from his perspective, you know his job, your job was then just to stand, whatever witness says where they were and film where she says what she saw she saw?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>By Ms. Alizadeh is just to see could she see that, are there things in the way, was it such as that, correct?</narrative>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Now, you said that from filming it, the camera would not focus beyond the screen?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The human eye could see through the screen and focus on a point farther than that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The camera I was using at the time has focal limitations and would focus just on the screen.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Let me ask you this, from your eyewitness perspective, could you see, not what she saw, could you see the place where she said she saw something?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>From that specific perspective, she could only see where Michael Brown came to rest.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. And so from whatever perspective  she was, she could not see farther west to where the officer's vehicle was?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. But you are standing in her position, you could see where Michael Brown's body had been?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>How much farther west could you see beyond Michael Brown's body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>You could see from the angle she was at, which was to give you an orientation because I can see it in my head. She was on the northeast part of the apartment complex.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Let's use your diagram.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Here it is. Her apartment building, if this is the entrance to Copper Creek Court, her apartment building is farther back this way, which would be the upper right-hand corner of the diagram. Again, this is not to scale, this building in particular comes from close to this driveway. Her perspective, and if I can come up here and use my finger to show, her perspective would have been on this line and the corner of the building would block the red stain where Michael Brown's body had been. You could just barely see  the stain in the road, the red stain in the road where his body had been.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>The large stain that was at his head?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, that was still present. It was at an angle just like this, where this building would have come out at that angle and cut that part of the scene off where she couldn't see anything else.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>Okay. Do you remember her name?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I just wrote down her address.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p>When that witness testifies, we will play that video for what it's worth given the focal limitations of the camera? Could she see to the east the full rest of the crime scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, it was a third floor apartment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Anybody else? And as always, if there are questions later on of this officer and you would like to have him brought back, he will come back. All right. That concludes the testimony of Detective And that will conclude the evidence for today, September 3rd, of the grand jury investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown.  (Court reporter reads the end of the recording information and that is the end of the September 3rd, 2014 grand jury hearing for today.)</p>
