(174.1,684.845) inquire of anything that you think is relevant and
(173.5,661.335) we want you to.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(250.74,637.805) Sheila and I will ask questions of
(173.49,614.285) witnesses as we have been going on. If at any time
(173.98,590.775) you want to inquire, anything is relevant. There is
(173.74,567.255) no, there is no objections to questions and we would
(173.5,543.725) have in a courtroom or anything of that nature,
(173.86,520.205) okay.

(330.32,496.695) (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 10
(326.61,473.175) marked for identification.)
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.78,449.645) MS. ALIZADEH: So with that being said,
(174.37,426.125) I'm going to play Grand Jury Exhibit 10, which is a
(173.95,402.615) DVD and it is an audio recording, and for the
(173.97,379.085) record, this DVD contains a number of interviews of
(173.84,355.575) other witnesses. And so for the record, I'm going
(173.72,332.055) to be playing the interview of Dorian Johnson and
(173.94,308.525) Sheila said the transcript of that interview is
(173.87,285.015) given to you.
--++ new paragraph!
(253.49,261.495) (Interview is being played at this time.)
--++ new paragraph!
(249.78,237.975) MS. ALIZADEH: Anybody want to take a
(173.3,214.455) break right now or keep going?
--++ new paragraph!
(251.14,190.935) It is 11:17, let's take about a five
(173.01,167.415) minute or so break and stand up and move around a
(174.05,143.885) little bit.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(337.99,120.365) (Recess)
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.78,684.845) MS. ALIZADEH: It is 11:24 and I'm going
(173.72,661.335) to resume the playing of the interview of Dorian
(173.91,637.805) Johnson.
--++ new paragraph!
(253.53,614.285) (The interview is being played.)
--++ new paragraph!
(253.53,590.775) (End of the playing of the interview of
(172.98,567.255) Mr. Johnson.)
--++ new paragraph!
(249.78,543.725) MS. ALIZADEH: It is 12:13, I think your
(174.11,520.205) lunch is going to be here at 12:30. What I would
(173.3,496.695) propose we do because this is not going to take very
(174.11,473.175) long at all is that I have what I've marked as Grand
(173.91,449.645) Jury Exhibit 11.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(330.32,426.125) (Grand Jury Exhibit Number 11
(326.61,402.615) marked for identification.)
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.78,379.085) MS. ALIZADEH: Which is another disc or
(173.95,355.575) DVD and it contains video from the Ferguson Market,
(173.72,332.055) the incident you heard Dorian Johnson talk about.
(173.88,308.525) They went in, got the Cigarillos and left the store.
(173.88,285.015) They are pretty brief clips. You want to watch them
(173.74,261.495) now since we have 15 minutes and then I thought
(173.61,237.975) during lunch, you also heard during his interview
(173.71,214.455) that he was drawing on some maps and we have copies
(173.84,190.935) of those maps. And also he made a drawing I can't
(174.05,167.415) find it in my office right now, I think Sheila might
(173.5,143.885) have one.
--++ new paragraph!
(251.19,120.365) I thought while you are eating lunch, you
(174.1,684.41) can pass around those maps and look at them as you
(173.83,660.9) are relaxing if you want to. This will only take a
(174.09,637.37) couple minutes. You all right with me playing this
(173.74,613.85) now?
--++ new paragraph!
(250.81,590.34) So for the record a DVD, that on the DVD
(174.07,566.82) itself it says 14-43984, and it says video segments.
--++ new paragraph!
(250.67,543.29) There is no audio with this disc.
--++ new paragraph!
(253.52,519.77) (Video is being played at this time.)
--++ new paragraph!
(249.78,496.26) MS. ALIZADEH: Now, for the record that
(173.5,472.74) was called register snippet and that was a view of
(173.5,449.21) where the cash register is and the counter is.
--++ new paragraph!
(250.81,425.69) So this next snippet, it is called door
(174.0,402.18) snippet. It is at the door of the food store, the
(174.09,378.65) convenience store.
--++ new paragraph!
(253.5,355.14) (Playing of the video clip.)
--++ new paragraph!
(249.78,331.62) MS. ALIZADEH: Would anybody like to see
(173.72,308.09) those snippets again? And of course, you can watch
(173.72,284.58) them at any other time you wish.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(450.11,261.06) Can we ask you a
(173.84,237.54) question, both, either one of you a question about
(173.01,214.02) maybe we'll find out more later, but how this
(173.3,190.5) pertains or relates to the knowledge that maybe
(173.59,166.98) Officer Wilson would of had at the time?
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.78,143.45) MS. ALIZADEH: You will hear some evidence
(173.84,119.93) about that.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(373.3,684.7) Okay.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.776,661.19) MS. ALIZADEH: There will be, we have a
(174.08,637.66) lot of witnesses to call still.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(373.3,614.14) Okay.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.78,590.63) MS. ALIZADEH: A lot of these things, it
(174.09,567.11) is difficult for us to, if we were in a trial, you
(173.71,543.58) try to put things on in order that people can make
(174.02,520.06) sense of it. But in a trial you make an opening
(174.01,496.55) statement so you can outline for the jury what the
(173.83,473.03) evidence is going to be.
--++ new paragraph!
(250.5,449.5) But we are not doing that here, and so you
(173.8,425.98) all understand you are hearing things and not
(174.45,402.47) knowing what's left to come.
--++ new paragraph!
(250.67,378.94) There will be, I believe, other witnesses
(173.5,355.43) who talk about that, so we'll just have to wait and
(174.02,331.91) see how that testimony comes in.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(449.94,308.38) Will we hear
(173.72,284.87) testimony any of witnesses inside the store to the
(173.83,261.35) events that happened in the store?
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.78,237.83) MS. ALIZADEH: Possibly. Sheila and I
(173.5,214.31) have not made out our list. Our intention is to
(174.06,190.79) call as many people as we can. Some people may not
(173.3,167.27) be cooperative. We will serve subpoenas on people
(173.499,143.74) who don't voluntarily agree to come in.
--++ new paragraph!
(251.19,120.22) I don't know how else to explain that
(173.84,684.41) other than we are going to have as many people as we
(174.09,660.9) can, that we think know anything about this coming
(174.1,637.37) in and testifying. So there will be many, many
(173.49,613.85) witnesses to come, all right?
--++ new paragraph!
(250.81,590.34) So at this time it is 12:23, if you all
(173.49,566.82) will just break for lunch and your lunch will be
(173.5,543.29) here in less than ten minutes. And the plan right
(173.74,519.77) now is shortly after 1:00, we'll give you an update
(173.84,496.26) of when we might start up in the afternoon.

(345.67,472.74) (Recess)
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.78,449.21) MS. WHIRLEY: So present is Sheila
(173.23,425.69) Whirley, Kathi Alizadeh, Dorian Johnston is our
(173.49,402.18) witness. We have 12 grand jurors and the court
(173.97,378.65) reporter.
--++ new paragraph!
(250.73,355.14) Dorian Johnson, I said your name, I
(173.86,331.62) generally ask
--++ new paragraph!
(249.78,308.09) MS. ALIZADEH: Sheila, he needs to be
(174.04,284.58) sworn in.
--++ new paragraph!
(249.78,261.06) MS. WHIRLEY: Thank you.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(312.18,684.41) DORIAN JOHNSON,
(173.84,660.9) of lawful age, having been first duly sworn to
(173.71,637.37) testify the truth, the whole truth, and
(173.74,613.85) nothing but the truth in the case aforesaid,
(173.62,590.34) deposes and says in reply to oral
(174.09,566.82) interrogatories, propounded as follows, to-wit:
--++ new paragraph!
(327.293,543.29) EXAMINATION
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(249.78,519.77) MS. WHIRLEY: Thank you.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(173.71,496.26) BY MS. WHIRLEY:
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,469.28) Q So introduce yourself to the grand jurors?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,445.761) A Good afternoon everybody. My name is
(173.93,425.69) Dorian Johnson, as you all well know. I'm thankful
(173.71,402.18) that you all could come, part of your busy schedule,
(174.39,378.65) I don't know if you all have anything else to do,
(174.37,355.14) I'm thankful you can come and hear my story.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,328.16) Q Thank you. Now, Dorian, I stand in the
(173.3,308.09) back of the room. I do that so that we can have a
(174.08,284.58) conversation and you will talk loud enough for even
(173.01,261.06) me to hear you. These mikes that you see, they are
(174.42,237.54) just recording, they're not really making your voice
(174.1,214.02) louder, so speak up for me, okay? We have a lot of
(174.07,190.5) fans in here to try to keep the room a little bit
(174.08,166.98) cooler.
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,140.001) A Okay, yes, ma'am.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,116.47) Q Okay, good, that's better. Now, you came
(173.5,684.12) here on your own free will; is that correct?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,657.451) A Correct, yes.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,633.91) Q You do have an attorney, your attorney is
(174.18,613.56) Freeman Bosley?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,586.891) A That's correct also.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,563.36) Q And he's outside sitting, he cannot be a
(173.3,543.0) part of the testimony, he cannot be in here while
(173.98,519.48) you testify, but he's outside and you know that if
(173.98,495.97) you ever want to take a break and consult with him,
(173.84,472.45) or talk to him, you have a right to do that.
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,445.761) A Oh, okay.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,422.23) Q Do you understand?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,398.731) A Yes, ma'am.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,375.19) Q Your mother came too, as a matter of fact?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,351.691) A Oh, yes, she's here with me also.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,328.16) Q And she's in the TV room right now. We
(173.01,307.8) made her comfortable sitting in the TV room.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(288.77,284.29) Now, we told you that you are not a
(174.07,260.77) focus of any criminal charges, right?
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(210.97,234.091) A Yes.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,210.56) Q That we just want to hear from you being
(173.72,190.21) the person that was with Michael Brown that day, in
(173.98,166.69) your own words, what happened, that's what we are
(173.5,143.16) here for. We are not here to prosecute you. You
(173.01,119.64) may tell us some things that have to do with
(174.08,684.41) criminal behavior. I know there is an incident at
(173.72,660.9) the store, at the Ferguson Market. We will play
(173.71,637.37) that video and ask you to tell us what's going on
(173.72,613.85) there.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(289.07,590.34) There is some talk about smoking weed
(173.85,566.82) and those kind of things, but that's not anything
(173.71,543.29) that we are here to prosecute you for. I want to
(173.01,519.77) make that clear on the record, okay?
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(210.97,492.811) A Yes, ma'am.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,469.28) Q Because we want you to feel free and
(174.09,449.21) comfortable to tell us only the truth here, that's
(173.5,425.69) what we are trying to do. This is a fact finding
(173.01,402.18) mission, okay?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,375.201) A Yes, ma'am.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,351.68) Q All right. So with that said, let's talk
(173.84,331.62) about you knew Mike Brown, right? You call him Big
(172.98,308.09) Mike?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,281.131) A I'm going to ask if I can refer to him as
(173.69,261.06) Big Mike, that's the way it sounds funny saying if
(174.05,237.54) it is okay with the jury.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,210.56) Q Absolutely, I will call him Big Mike too
(174.06,190.5) if you don't mind.
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,163.531) A Thank you.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,139.99) Q So you were good friends with Big Mike?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,116.481) A We were good friends, but not childhood
(174.05,684.12) friends.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,657.44) Q So tell us how you met Big Mike?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,633.921) A I met Big Mike, I recently had, well, not
(173.97,613.56) recently, but I just moved in those apartments, I
(173.5,590.05) had me and my girlfriend, my daughter, we were
(174.0,566.53) staying in the apartment, two bedroom apartment, I
(173.5,543.0) had a roommate. I just moved over there.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(289.6,519.48) I only been staying in those
(173.84,495.97) apartments for about eight months. I met Big Mike
(173.85,472.45) around the fifth month that I was living there. I
(173.01,448.92) met him through a friend that I know from the area,
(173.74,425.4) neighborhood down the street where he lived.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(211.57,398.72) Q Okay.
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,375.201) A So when he introduced Big Mike, they came
(173.72,354.85) to my apartment one day, they want to play video
(173.88,331.33) games, you know, relax and have conversation. And I
(173.59,307.8) didn't have a problem with that.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(289.21,284.29) So they came over, and when he came
(173.72,260.77) to my door, he was real quiet when he came in, you
(174.45,237.25) know, he was the biggest person in the room. So it
(174.0,213.73) struck me as kind of strange, I don't really be
(173.85,190.21) around people that I don't know. So I asked him a
(173.84,166.69) question, I was like, hey, how you doing. I live
(173.49,143.16) here, this is my house.
--++ new paragraph!
(287.98,119.64) And he spoke back to me, he said I'm
(173.8,684.12) all right, you know. And he just kind of kept it to
(173.49,660.61) hisself. I felt that he was good, he was just a
(173.3,637.08) person that didn't speak a lot. So he was all right
(173.5,613.56) with me to be in my house.
--++ new paragraph! (at new indentation)
(211.57,586.88) Q Did you socialize with him on a regular
(173.3,566.53) basis after that or how often would you say you was
(174.1,543.0) in his presence?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,516.321) A Like I said, it was my apartment, so you
(174.45,495.97) know, I had bills and things like that. I was
(173.5,472.45) working at the time of me first moving into the
(173.84,448.92) apartments. I recently lost my job around the sixth
(173.01,425.4) month, I met him in the fifth month, so now I'm on
(173.72,401.89) the verge of finding new work and finding a way to
(173.3,378.36) pay the bills. So I was not able to connect with
(173.5,354.85) him on a daily basis or even every other day because
(174.37,331.33) I'm trying to find work.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,304.63) Q And what was your address at the time that
(173.98,284.29) you met him?
(210.97,257.611) A
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,234.08) Q And did he live in that same apartment
(174.1,213.73) complex?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,187.051) A No, he did not. He stayed in an apartment
(174.1,166.69) complex behind, there is another one called
(173.58,143.16) Northwinds and it was right behind Canfield. When I
(173.01,119.64) met him, the time that I met him.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,680.95) Q When you met him. And on August the 9th
(173.82,660.61) at the time of the shooting, was he living in
(173.58,637.08) Northwinds.
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,610.401) A No, at that time he had recently moved out
(173.84,590.05) of his grandmother's house. He was staying with a
(174.05,566.53) friend that I knew in Canfield across the parking
(174.08,543.0) lot.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,516.31) Q Okay. All right. So when you first met
(173.5,495.97) him, he was living with his grandmother in
(173.58,472.45) Northwinds?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,445.761) A Correct, yes, ma'am.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,422.23) Q And so after you met him, so you had known
(173.5,401.89) him before the shooting probably a couple of months,
(173.73,378.36) two to three months?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,351.691) A Yes, maybe a month or two.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,328.16) Q A month or two?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,304.641) A A month or two.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,281.12) Q But you really didn't hang out with him?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,257.611) A No, ma'am, not on a daily basis.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,234.08) Q You were a few years older?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,210.571) A Yeah.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,187.04) Q He was 18 you were 22?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,163.531) A 22, yes, ma'am.
--++ new paragraph!
(211.57,139.99) Q But you liked him?
--++ new paragraph!
(210.97,116.481) A Right, he was a real comfortable guy. I
