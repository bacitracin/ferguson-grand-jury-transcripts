        <speech by="#mr-mcculloch">
          <p> Thank you. I'm Bob McCulloch, the Prosecutor, for the record. I want to talk to you a little bit about this. As you are well aware of what we are here about and that is the shooting death of Michael Brown. I want to tell you how this is going to proceed. Obviously, it is going to be different from a lot of the other cases that you've heard, that you've heard during your term. First things first. Let me introduce, I say a lot of this you already know. These two ladies, for the record, Kathi Alizadeh, Shelia Whirley, they will be the primary, if not the exclusive attorneys working in the grand jury on this case. Obviously, I hope, obviously, there be a lot of other people working on things outside of us getting it ready for the presentation that will be made by Kathi and/or Sheila. Kathi was the prosecutor I have on call for the month of August for all homicide calls. So she received the call about this shooting within minutes of the time the County Police were notified by the Ferguson Police. So she has been working  with the police and lots of other things on this since the very beginning. My procedure is always that I have a prosecutor on call solely for homicide cases and they stay with that case from start to finish, whatever that ultimately may be. Sheila, as you know, has been assigned to the grand jury for this term and so she will continue with this grand jury on this case for as long as it does take. There are a few things I do want to go over, first and foremost, to tell you that this is the first, last and probably the only time I think that you will see me in relation to this case. Certainly in the grand jury. Everything that we do, everything that you do, will be recorded with the court reporter, who is under the same oath, essentially, as all the witnesses. As I said, Kathi and Sheila will be the primary attorneys, the attorneys responsible for presenting everything to the grand jury. Really, I'm going to go over just a few things to make sure that we have kind of the ground rules, but the procedure covered. As you know, your term ends on the lOth of  September. You also have dockets, there is no docket next week, but on the 3rd and lOth, we have dockets. Those dockets will be adjusted, but they won't be canceled. But they will be adjusted to accommodate whatever time that we need for presentations on this case. This case is still in the middle of an investigation, there is a lot going on and certainly you are well aware of what's going on in the evenings and during the day and even out in front of the courthouse here on occasions. So there is a lot that is still going on with the officers gathering the evidence, evidence is being tested, being evaluated. I say evaluated, it is being looked at, firearms evidence, the firearms people are looking at that, DNA evidence, the DNA are examining that. In addition, the federal government, U.S. Department of Justice, is doing a parallel, but an independent investigation of the same thing. So a lot of, actually everything pretty much that the County Police or any other state or local department is doing is being replicated by the U.S. Attorney, by the FBI, or by the Justice Department, they are all part of the Justice  Department. As that is going back and forth and there is some witnesses they will be talking to that the County Police may not necessarily be talking to. Some that the County had talked to that they haven't or won't talk to. And so, but all of that will be traded. We're giving them all the statements we have, they are passing statements and any other information that they have on this matter back to us. So it is still independent of one another, but sharing the information because what is significant to this case is also significant to theirs. They are looking at different possibilities. The federal government and the state government are not the same. We have these criminal charges, they look at potential civil rights violations, but for the same conduct that we are looking at for any potential criminal violations. So that may add a little bit, a little bit of a delay. I really don't want to say a delay, but kind of giving things to you out of order here somewhat. Like a trial, lots of information is going to come to you and it is going to come out of  chronological order. We will kind of go through that just as a schedule. The schedule is just that. There will be time if we have a particular area, just for example, the DNA evidence. If that is available or when that is available and all of it is available, not just part of it, we will have the time that is in the next two weeks to present that to you all at once. If it is a number of witness statements, we will present all of those to you. We will have it all organized and bring it in. By the time everything is finished, you will have heard everything, you will have every statement, there will be as many witnesses to come in and testify. If they made statements, you will not only get the statements they made, whether they are to police, FBI, or television or on the internet or anything else. If we've got those statements, you will have those statements. You will also have the witness who will come in and testify as to that. Some certainly might be they are just statements that are floating around on the internet and nobody knows who is making that statement, but everybody is doing that and the FBI is doing what they can to locate any of those or the source of  them. So the schedule though after September lOth, your term is extended, and the only matter that you will hear anything on will be this Michael Brown case, the Michael Brown shooting. All you get is that so you won't have the docket. There will be another grand jury that starts the week after that who will be doing what you have been doing for the past four months. By the way, greatly appreciate your service on that. I don't want to lose that in the message here. You have done a great job, a great service for the people of this county. But the schedule will then, it is as flexible as flexible can be. It is the only matter that you have and so there is no requirement that you meet on Wednesdays. So whenever all 12 people are available, because all the evidence will be presented to all 12, so we get all 12 of you together, we will work with everybody's schedule. Obviously, we want to be as expeditious as possible, but not rush through it. If that means we are meeting four hours in the morning and whatever works is what we are going to do. Saturdays, evenings, however it works for everybody's schedule,  and as long as you get it. If all 12 of you have an entire day, we will have an entire day. If you have four hours sometime, we will work all of that out, but we will work, obviously, around your schedules and you know how that's been. It is a little easier, I suppose, when you could tell family and employers and the like every Wednesday you had to be gone. So this will be a little different, so we will have to coordinate all of that. Also, not necessarily a requirement, we do want to meet here, but there is no requirement of that. If it turns out to be a Wednesday, then we'll figure out something on that. Everything will be recorded. Starting with the oath by the court reporter and everything that I'm saying now and everything that anybody says, whether it is a witness, whether it is one of the attorneys, or one of the jurors, will be recorded as we are going along. The value in the court reporter is that we're getting at least a rough transcript as we are going along. So that will, we won't have to wait six months for all of these tapes to be typed up if we did it in some other fashion.  The other is that the questions, you know, unlike a trial jury, you know, you can and have been discussing what you've heard on perhaps between witnesses or during breaks and the like. Remind you that's part of your deliberation and so none of that happens while there is anybody else in the room and that includes, of course, the attorney and the court reporter. At the end of every witness, the reporter will make an announcement that essentially he is going to finalize the disc. For every witness who testifies and every session of their testimony, there will be a separate disc made so that when he finalizes that, what it does is it finalizes the disc. After that, it can't be altered, nothing can be added, nothing can be deleted. And so if that witness comes back at some other time, there will be a separate disc for that and we will do the same. We will do that with every person who comes in and testifies. You will have presented to you every bit of evidence from the photos, from the scene of the shooting, diagrams of that, the physical evidence that was seized at the time, at the location, the  DNA evidence, anything and everything that pertains to this case will be presented to the grand jury. It will all be available to you for your review as it is coming in. Sheila, primarily, will be at least getting things started in terms of asking the witness questions, much as you've seen her for the whole summer doing that. Jurors, and you're experienced enough now that you can ask whatever questions you want to ask. Any item, anything you want to ask any witness, absolutely ask that information. If something occurs to you sometime after that witness is gone, we will get the witness back at some point and ask those questions again. If somebody else says something, you need to clarify it, we will get witnesses back to do whatever it is that you need done. The one thing we can't do in terms of questions, let me back up a little bit on that while we are talking about the records on that. Just remember that it is going to take a few minutes to finalize this disc once that witness is finished testifying. So if you have discussion, you want to talk or ask each other questions,  anything at all about that, make sure you wait long enough that that is finalized and they understand is out of here and the attorneys out of here. They will stick around long enough to remind you of that, wait until everybody is gone before you talk about it because that's, that's not something that anybody but the jurors hear. If you have a question about procedure, the attorneys will answer that. Who is coming in next, you know, we are taking a break now or can we take a break now, anything along the procedure the attorneys will certainly answer that. If you have a question about what a witness said or what is going on or did this witness say this, they're not going to answer those questions. If anything, we will get the witness back to answer any more questions that you asked, but we are not going to answer those questions. Just a couple other things. I assume the judge talked to you this morning, of course, about your oath, of course, both very similar to what just took, whatever the witness will take, that these are confidential proceedings, that nothing leaves this room unless and until ordered by the court or some other legal method. I will talk  about those in just a second. The other is the confidentiality and the oath and the anonymity. You are anonymous. You are protected by law from all, your names are not public, your addresses, no information about you is public. There may be some, the demographics of it, I think that is information that can be passed out in terms of, you know, race, gender.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Age.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#mr-mcculloch">
          <p> I won't say the age. The general location that we have. Say, I don't know, three grand jurors who live in municipalities and 12 who live in unincorporated or nine live in unincorporated. We have X number who are outside of the 270 loop, X number inside. So many above 70, below 70, all of that demographic information, but nothing that would, anybody would ever be able to identify any individual from just that no matter how they try to put it together. And that is, I just want to share, that's protected by law that's been litigated and those names, the information does not get released. So the other is with the parking. We are trying to arrange the parking very similar to what  we had today so that you are inside. Once we're past September lOth, you are meeting on a different schedule, on your schedule, that makes things a lot easier because, you know, everybody knows that the grand jury meets on Wednesday. So if you are meeting some other day, you know, there may be media around, but the good thing about construction going on next door is we can kind of work around the visibility of it, particularly with the parking that we had. We will have all of that arranged. And the media, you know, the media kind of comes and goes around here. I did a number of interviews with local people today for a couple reasons, one is to get it all out of the way. So we're finished with, for the most part, with any kind of interviews with that. I can't control whether anybody shows up outside and just hangs outside the doors and all of that. If there is a protest scheduled or the media is going to be here. We will work with that again. We will know who is there and what's there and all of that. If need be, get you in and get you out of the building without worrying about any of that. The only other thing I'd say when you are  coming in, don't wear the grand jury badge and that will, won't tip anybody off that you are on the grand jury, we will have all of that stuff. Am I missing anything?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Note taking.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#mr-mcculloch">
          <p> Oh, you are right. Note taking. You take, as you know, all the notes that you want. Write down anything and everything. If a thought occurs to you, you want to talk to the witness, take all the notes that you want. The notes, of course, can't leave here. They are your notes and your notes alone. Fellow grand jurors won't see your notes and you won't see their notes. At the end of the day or end of the session, the notes will be collected and they will be secured. Any evidence that is presented to you, physical evidence, of course, also will be collected and it will be secured. We have highly secure evidence lockers within the complex here. All of that will be that. At the end of that, you can use your notes for any deliberation when everything is finished. At the end, just so you know, there are going to be massive amounts of information and physical items that are coming here in the next month. You're not  going to remember everything. The witness today testifies, you're not going to remember that a month from now, but all of that and the transcripts will all be available and you'll have as long as you need, as long as you want to go through everything again before you start your deliberations. While you are doing deliberations, all of that is available. Unlike a trial jury where you have to send a note out to the judge and the judge would decide if you get something or you don't get something, that rule doesn't apply here. Everything will be here in the room with you and you will have access to all of it. You, of course, have access to your notes throughout all of that. At the end of all of that, you won't have access to those notes, is that it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> I want to say that what Bob said, everything is going to be recorded in this room while we're presenting this case. That, of course, doesn't include your deliberations, those will not be recorded. And when we have juries who are hearing evidence in trial, typically the jury, not typically, always the jury is told prior to trial to keep an open mind throughout the entire  process, don't form any opinions until you've heard all of the evidence. There's no requirement that you all can't talk about things amongst yourselves. So if there is something that you all talk about and decide, we would like to hear from this person or you have a question about us bringing another witness in, you all can discuss that amongst yourselves so long as you are not deliberating and starting to form opinions until you have heard everything, okay. So there will be times for you all when there is no recording going on, where you all can discuss your schedule, you know, when we might meet again, and if there's any questions that you have that you want us to try to provide the answer for. Again, as Bob said, Sheila and I can't answer other than just procedural things or questions of law. But if there is some question that you have, if we can find somebody who can answer that question for you, we will do so, we'll try to bring somebody in to answer those questions, okay?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#mr-mcculloch">
          <p> I'm glad she said it. You do need, and I know you will keep an open mind on everything. You haven't heard a single thing yet  other than what has been in the media, believe me that's not evidence. Don't form any opinion on anything that you've heard, good, bad or ugly in the media. Everything that's been collected, every statement that has ever been made, it will all be here for you. You need to keep that open mind to give everybody, including the entire community, a full and as open as it can be, but certainly as thorough and as expedient of all the evidence that you can. I know people keep talking about the transparency, at the end of all of this, depending on your determination, as other cases, if there are charges that you find should be lodged and are lodged, then all of that information will come out pursuant to the course of the case. There are rules that apply then as to how things are handled and all of that. It doesn't come out right away because you can't prejudice a potential jury panel. So all of that evidence, just like here, is presented to a trial jury in the courtroom and not put out in the media. So everybody can see it and then make their mind up before they ever come into a courtroom. If your determination is that there are no  charges to be filed, then everything will be released immediately or as close to immediately as we can get, and that's everything. Your deliberations aren't, as I said, your deliberations are not recorded and never will be recorded, notes won't be released, but every bit of evidence that you have, the testimony of the witnesses who come in, the statements of the witnesses, the physical evidence, the photographs, everything that you have seen and heard will be released to the public. That is as transparent as we can get short of putting a pool TV camera in here and that's not going to happen. It is, obviously, an awesome burden, but it is going to be an awful lot of work and we will make it as orderly and organized as we can to you. As I said, if there is anything at all that we can do to do that, working with your schedules, work longer, we have no set hours. So whatever it takes, we will get that to you. We don't want to rush through anything, but we also don't want to drag it out. I'm anticipating, in all honesty, without basing it on a whole lot, that we hope to have this completed by the middle of October. It doesn't mean  every day that you will be here from September lOth until then, but the more days we can have some session, the more expedient this will get out there and that's important to everybody, of course. The most important thing that you get all the information and all of the evidence and make your determination on that. Any questions now, procedure that I can answer? Alternate jurors, do we have them?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#mr-mcculloch">
          <p> We are in the hope that all 12 of you are perfect, healthy specimens, who have no plans to leave town or go on vacation for two months. All 12 will hear everything and the only way we have alternates is to have them in here at the time and we do that at a trial, but here it is just, it doesn't work in the grand jury. So we have all 12 when we can get all 12 of you together. If we can only get 11 together, we are going to have to find a different time. I hope everybody can be as flexible as possible, and again, we will be as flexible as possible. We have no set hours. Every day is Monday, weekends, whatever works for you is when we are going to be here.  Morning, noon or night, or any day. Thank you. As I said, this is probably the last time you will see me. I can't imagine what it would be unless there is something that came up that you wanted to see me, so thanks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> As Bob said, Sheila and I are both going to be presenting this case to you and there may be times where I know Sheila has a case set for trial next week and it might just be, of course, we don't have next week. There might be days where you are only go to see me, only go to see Sheila, we are trying to split up the work as much as we can just to make it easier for the both of us, but there is no, don't read into anything about why is Sheila only having this witness or Kathi is presenting this witness because we are just trying to split it up. And so on days when Sheila might be presenting somebody, if I can be, I will also be here in the room, but I won't be commenting, I won't be asking any questions, it will be Sheila presenting, and the same thing on a day where I might be presenting a witness, Sheila may be here, but it is just for our benefit. We both want to see as much and as hear as much as we can, but there  might be times when we are not available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#mr-mcculloch">
          <p> Good thing about being the boss is I have a lot of flexibility in adjusting their schedules, so that will happen, but we will keep that to a minimum because we want to, in addition to all 12 of you hearing here, and the two of them here as much as possible. You will hear everything, they will hopefully hear everything.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> I am Sheila Whirley. Present in the room is Kathi Alizadeh and the witness, is with the Medical Examiner's Office. He is the investigator, he is going to take the oath in a minute and also present are Jurors 1 through 12. would you approach to take the oath?</p>

          <p>Okay. And I want to talk a little bit more about your background before we get into the crux of this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>What is the purpose of a medical investigator at a Medical Examiner's Office, why have you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We are the eyes and ears of our pathologist. The person who is conducting the autopsy. They don't go to the scenes, we go to the scenes for them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>And bring back information for them so they can properly do the autopsy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>I see. When you go to the scene, do you have any special tools that you take with you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We have cameras and things to establish the time of death, and other equipment that we collect evidence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. So tell us what a medical examiner does once, well, first of all, how do you get the call?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Usually a police officer or hospital or paramedic will call us and let us know there is a deceased person.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Do you have a certain timeframe that you must follow? I know the person is always deceased by the time you are called, correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Are there some time parameters when you need to arrive to the scene?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. So you go by yourself?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. Do you call anyone to come?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We do have a delivery service that we call. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>What is a delivery service?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Delivery service is the person who picks up the body.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Do you call the delivery service when you get the call?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Once you get there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, once I get the call, I call them to let them know what is going on, where it is at.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>They meet you there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>So at the scene once you arrive, what do you do? Like take us through an investigation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I try to meet the reporting officer, speak to him, find out what happened. They go and look at the body and see if everything is consistent with what he told me or whatever witnesses told him, and then I come back and I would talk to the family or one of the witnesses if they were there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>So when you talk to people, it is not necessarily the people who directly saw the incident?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>You are getting kind of hearsay information? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>And you don't necessarily see what is occurring yourself any of these times?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>By the time you get there, it has happened?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>After the fact, correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Why do you talk to the officers?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Because the first responding officer makes contact with the person who called the police to find out what's going on.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Why do you need to know what's going on. I mean, there is a deceased body, why do you need to know more?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>To see if the story is consistent with his death, as opposed to suicide or a homicide, just trying to establish a timeline.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>But you are not the one who makes the call as to what the cause of death is?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Or the manner of death?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Or whether or not it is a homicide or a suicide, you don't make that call?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>You just gather it for the pathologist?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>All right. Do you write a report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. How long generally does your investigation take?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It can take anywhere from several minutes to an hour or two.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. And what's included in your report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>My initial contact with the reporting officer, the reporting person, the location, what I saw when I got there, the condition of the body, and a paragraph or two on witness statements.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Who is your supervisor, who do you report to?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Chief Investigator</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Who would approve your report, is that the same person?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>He would.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>All right. Do you generally take photographs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. And let's talk specifically about the case involving the shooting of Michael Brown. Did you take photographs? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Why not?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>My battery in my camera died.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Were photographs being taken?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>By whom?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>St. Louis County Police Department.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Like their identification unit?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Their identification unit, correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>You saw them taking photographs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Do you have access to those photographs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>If we need them, we can get them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Is that something you would want, photographs?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Sometimes the pathologist asks for them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. Do you know if they were asked for in this case?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I don't know.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. I thought I heard you say, or if you didn't, let me ask the question, did you take measurements of anything?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, we can if we need to, yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Did you in this case?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Because you didn't need to?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Why not?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I got there, it was self-explanatory what happened. Somebody shot somebody. There was no question as to any distances or anything of that nature at the time I was there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. And if it turns out there was some concern about the distances, that's not something that you would be qualified to tell us about?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>If I took the measurements I could tell you about them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>What kind of distances when you say distance?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Like for the Brown case?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Uh-huh.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Maybe like if he was close enough to leave stippling on his clothing, things of that nature.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>So you didn't take any measurements though?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct, I didn't see no stippling, no indication how close he actually was going to be.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Did you look for stippling?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Where did you look for it at? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Around the wounds.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Wounds?</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>When you say stippling, what is stippling?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It is gunpowder, burning of the gun powder.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>You say you looked for it around his wounds?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>And what did you see?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>I didn't see any.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. So this occurred on, tell us the date again?</p>

          <p>Correct.</p>

          <p>You did?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Yeah, the initial call came into our on duty investigator, he gave me the information and I called the sergeant.</p>

          <p>What did you call him for?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>To set up a time when they need me, when to actually be out there.</p>

          <p>Go ahead. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Why did you need to set up a time?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Because other officers are responding to the scene, St. Louis County detectives, their ID unit, that may take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours before I could actually get in and actually see the body.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>So you don't want to be there when they are doing their thing?</p>

          <p>Approximately 1430, 2:30.</p>

          <p>That's 2:30. In about an hour. Is there any reason why it took you an hour to arrive?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am, just waited. I called them about 2:15, they said they were showing up, the ID people were there showing up. So I went ahead and responded to the scene.</p>

          <p>It was an apartment complex where crime  scene tape up, and a crowd has gathered, quite a few people there. He was deceased, was laying in the middle of the street. There was already some orange barriers around him to keep the crowd from seeing him.</p>

          <p>They were just, I don't know how to explain it. I guess voicing their concerns at what is going on, why is this taking so long, things of that nature.</p>

          <p>I went over there with the police officers, the ID officers, we removed the sheets, took photographs of his back, lifted up the shirt, took more photographs. Then we rolled him over, I placed white clean sheets down on the ground and rolled him over onto those. Took more photographs, documented the injuries, looked through his pockets, looked through his pants for any weapons or anything of that nature. And then got some clean paper bags, placed them on his hands and then we put him back on the sheet and into a white bag and sealed it up.</p>

          <p>I was walking back to my vehicle to make some phone calls and a lady came up and she asked me if I was a medical examiner, I told her I was. She asked me why the body was still on the street, why is it taking so long. I explained to her, you know, it takes a thorough investigation and crowd control, just getting everybody into the scene was taking time to do that and once everybody is here, we can get our information that we need and the evidence collected and then we can be out of here. Once everything starts, it doesn't take long.</p>

          <p>In looking at the report, I would like to clarify, the east and west position of the body may not be accurate, may not be correct. I was just going by the street that I came in on, that I came down. It should have been an east and west street. So that should have been west and his feet should have been east. Sometimes in a subdivision the streets, they curve, so his head may be a little bit off. Like southwest, and his feet may be northeast or something in a different report, but I should say that the head was pointing towards Florissant and his feet was, what's the name of the other street, the other main intersection that I came in on to get to Canfield.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>When you are writing your report, if there is something that you discover later, do you write a supplemental?</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Cases like, maybe on this kind of case like this, maybe the doctor asked us what was he doing before this happened. I would have to go back, contact an officer, maybe his family and find out why he was with so and so doing something or you know, whatever he was doing prior to his death. I may have to go back and get that information. They may call me, the doctor may ask me, can you call the family to see if they have any kind of medical history, and things of that nature.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p>Okay. And getting back again because one other thing I want to ask you about the injuries, did you count the gunshot wounds?</p>

          <p>Yes, ma'am, what I thought was gunshot wounds.</p>

          <p>Actually, it was me taking the stuff out of the pockets, detectives were standing there taking notes, the ID people were standing there, they should have taken photographs of it. After we  were done, I put it back in the pocket.</p>

          <p>No, ma'am. You were relying on them to take the actual photographs? </p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. And one in the top of the head too. And the position of the body, I didn't quite hear because I'm opposite from you. When looking at you, you said one arm was out, was that the right arm?</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I'm going to assume his head was west and his feet was east. His head was west and his feet were east and that's the modification? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That's what I have in my report, I just want to make sure I clarify that his head actually faced West Florissant and his feet was Glen Oak, Glen Oak was the other street. So his face was at West Florissant?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. And his feet were at Glen Oak?</p>

          <p>Yes. Like an officer comes up with a compass, it is northwest by southeast or it is east and west, you know, or south and north, I just want to clarify myself. I was trying to figure out where I was at by the street location.</p>
        </speech>

          <p> Okay, I see. </p>

          <p> Okay yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. I'm trying to get a clarification. You said that the police officers had already examined the body, photoing the body, taking pictures of everything on the body. Let me understand, when you examined the body, you searched the pockets and you found the marijuana, the two $5 bills and the two lighters. Why wouldn't those objects be outside the pockets if they had already examined the body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They don't actually examine, they just take photographs. They don't touch the body until I get there and I can't touch the body until the detectives get there. We kind of do it in tandem. We don't want to disturb the scene. They come in and they photograph everything like it is. I come in, if I move anything, then they photograph it again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> What's the purpose of doing it in tandem and not the police? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That way the scene doesn't get contaminated, things get moved around or kicked around and we all have different information then.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> There is information that the body may be able to tell the medical examiner or should be able to tell a medical examiner?</p>

          <p>Right.</p>

          <p>So approximately 1:30 p.m. to 2:30p.m.,  you called, but you said you arrived at the scene at about 2:30 approximately your time. Now, I understand you stated that after you got to the scene then you had to wait another hour, is that my understanding?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am, approximately about another hour. So actually your investigation didn't start until about 3:30 p.m. that day?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> So what was happening in that hour?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>What happens, the crime scene unit they show up, they have to get their cameras ready to make their placards, grab all of their little place cards and find evidence on the scene, mark the evidence, lay it there, take photographs of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>lot of time you have to clear out a way, a path for me to get to the body. I'll be walking through there kicking shell casings and different evidence around.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> So all of that was occurring?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That was going on then, correct. Like I  said, they just got there, they are talking amongst themselves on what they are going to do. There is several officers. Some transcribe, some give out measurements, some photograph, you have a transcriber with the photographer.</p>

          <p> This was St. Louis County on the scene?</p>

        </speech>

          <p> It is your understanding that Ferguson was on the scene first?</p>

          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> And then the scene was turned over to St. Louis County?</p>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Yes, sir. Were paramedics called initially do you know to, you know, the first instance, did they do anything to the body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I don't know if they were called or not. I know they arrived on scene shortly after it happened. I looked at the body, they didn't have no leads, any kind of what they usually do is put a lead on their body for EKGs to see if there is any kind of heartbeats. None of that was placed on there. Everything from there on is going to be  assumption. I don't want to assume what they did. Who would determine before you got there this person was deceased?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The paramedics or police officer, I don't know.</p>

          <p> When you got there, the body was deceased?</p>

          <p> Michael Brown was deceased?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. To just continue that, to put the EKG on to determine that, do they typically have to move the body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No. I guess from the wounds that they observed was actually a fatal wound.</p>

        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> So in 25 years of work, how common when you have responded at the scene for a shooting involved an officer and another civilian, is that something that happens often?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I have been on several of them. So several of them in 25 years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Several police shootings. So in this case, did it  seem peculiar or out of the ordinary that the shooting officer was not present?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, not at all. Not at all?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No. Do you know what the protocol is for that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They probably took him to the hospital or back to the police station interviews. Majority of the time, they're not there.</p>

          <p> Could I make a suggestion? I know you all aren't used to this, but when you do ask a question because we don't know how well this is all picking up until we listen to this later or have an opportunity to check it, so if you would make, you don't have to get right up on it, but make an effort to kind of speak into the microphone so that we can be sure that your questions are recorded, that would be great. If I see you not doing that because you are not used to it, I might say, could you get close to the mike, okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Let me just say, this is your mike, we are kind of sharing it, just to let you know.  You said, I guess, you looked for gun powder on the body?</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, sir. And you didn't find any?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. If you would have found some, what does that determine?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>That tells me that the weapon was fired at a certain distance from the body. So usually you can tell the closeness, I guess?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. If the altercation was maybe 12 inches or less when the gun fired.</p>

        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Just for the sake of clarification, you're not a ballistics expert?</p>

          <p> There if you would like, we anticipate you may hear evidence as this goes along about that, but he's not an expert in ballistics.</p>

          <p>Depends on weapon, age of the weapon.</p>

          <p> He can talk about his experiences and what he knows from his personal and professional training, but he's not really a ballistics expert. He asked a question that  led to another question.</p>

        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Sure. You said there were no leads on the body by paramedics?</p>

          <p>Yes, ma'am, they are small stickers. So they don't take those off?</p>

          <p>No. They would be on there?</p>

          <p> One other suggestion, try to refrain from using each other names just for again, for your sakes and for the anonymity part of it. We can have the court reporter redact that out. But of course, you know, it is on disc. This is all new to us, so we are learning as we go.</p>

          <p> Don't be afraid to ask a question because I've been kind of making suggestions. I don't want to intimidate anybody into, I don't want to ask a question because I think Kathi might yell at me. But if there is any, any other questions for this witness. You don't see any gun power or anything on his clothes, that doesn't mean when the gun went off, he couldn't find, he couldn't find that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. He could find that on other clothes?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. He may find some and he may not find some. Will we get a copy of your report? I'd like to see the report.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Yes. It is Exhibit Number 1. We will have that with your notes whenever you are ready to look at it, you can. Anything else? Are there any other things besides the wounds that you are looking at or documenting as you are looking at this particular body before you transport it or is it  just the wounds itself you are looking at?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I look at the whole body overall. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Position of the clothing, wounds, if it's a female, fingernails, everything from the top of the head down to the bottom of his feet we look at. Typically do you, when you file a report outside of this prior to this particular case, would you typically file photographs with your report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, sir. And then with regard to this specific case, are you anticipating getting those photos and filing with your report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>My own photos that I would take on the scene I would print out and be with my report. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>But the police photos, the police have those, but we can request those if we need them. Okay. Are you anticipating</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Or pathologist, I don't know the pathologist --</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> You will see those photos.  I'm just wondering is he anticipating to get those photos to file with your report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They don't get filed with our report. Okay, all right. Now, you said that you didn't take photos yourself, you said that you didn't take photos yourselves?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. Upon arriving at the scene as the batteries had died in your camera?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. All right. So I mean, is there some protocol with your department that you have to have your camera charged up all times?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. Just to alleviate this type of thing happening?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am. So right now we only have the photos that St. Louis County or whatever --</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. -- did? Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. My photographs would have been him laying on the ground with the sheets over him,  removing the sheets and his back, you know, the whole body. Uh-huh.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>And maybe that's it. Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Anywhere from two to four pictures, no more than that. Just trying to give the pathologist a picture of what's going on when this person died. Okay. Did you notice any other wounds on the body hands wise?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Just the abrasion on the back of the left hand and abrasion on his face and nothing really obvious.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> And just to clarify, you said your job is to document the body?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> As you find it and you also make a determination if you believe the body has been moved, was there any reason for you to believe that the body was moved in this case?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Now is it your job to look at anything around the body, whether it be blood splatters or shell casings? </p>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>

        </speech>

          <p> All right. But did you, do you recall making notes about any blood around the body?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Nothing in the reports, no.</p>
        </speech>

          <p> Did you see any shell casing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>There were numerous shell casings on the scene.</p>
        </speech>

          <p> Why not?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>At the time where they were at and they were still being processed, I guess let the police take care of that part. They are trying to figure out what shots were fired and what order, I didn't see no reason to see where they were at. Wouldn't the  shells kind of determine how the body was shot, what angle, how far, the distance?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They could at times.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> That's not what you are qualified to figure out?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. I don't know if they were moved, kicked around, people trampled through there, things of that nature. And the semiautomatic weapon, are the shell casings going to go out to the right side and eject.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> And so your purpose in being there and your function is to assist the medical examiner in doing their job?</p>

          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>

          <p> Just for the medical examiner?</p>
        </speech>

          <p> I anticipate you will be hearing testimony from the investigators who do document the crime scene in any kind of crime scene and especially such as this, there is going to be probably a number of officers who were doing different things at the crime scene to process the scene.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>This crime scene, can I say something? The crime scene was huge, he's here, some of his shoes are farther away from him. You have a vehicle and his hat, it may stretch out 100 yards. I'm just there for the body. Just trying to let our pathologist know he's here, there are other things there, this is what's going on with the body.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> It is your job to take the body when you leave?</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Correct. And the police will come in and photograph everything else, document it where it is at and take their notes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> You mentioned before that when you arrived at the scene and you saw the body for the first time, he was in the middle of the road, is that my understanding? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. This road that he's on, is this like one lane each direction?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Two lanes. Two lanes each side. Okay. So you have the center yellow dividing line?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am. Where was he in conjunction to that dividing line, was he right on it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yeah, right on the line. Was it bisecting him or dissecting?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It was dissecting.</p>
        </speech>

          <p>Yes, three in the head. I'm calling the face the head. Okay. So top of the head, forehead and eye are three.</p>

          <p>One closer to the middle of the arm -- There were two in the arm?</p>

          <p>Correct. You don't say there were nine, it could be come in here and come out here?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct, it is nine wounds. It is nine wounds.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. No nine shots?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>No, nine wounds.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> And just to be clear, you don't know whether those are entrance, exit, abrasions, you can't say?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>At the time I couldn't say, correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Can you say now?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>The medical report is done.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> I mean, that's not your report though?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. The doctor report is completed and he determined exits and entrances.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> A medical examiner could say?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> You can't say?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I could say. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> From firsthand experience can you tell us?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>I can tell an entrance and exit.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Can you tell us what the wounds were.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>But on these I couldn't, that's why I didn't.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay. The abrasions that you noticed, were they consistent with where he would have made contact when he hit the ground with his forehead and left hand or could that have been caused by some earlier altercation or something.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>To me it looked like it came from the ground, that is more of an assumption.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Why does it look like it came from the ground?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Because it looked more like a road rash abrasion as opposed to an altercation abrasion, like somebody scratching him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> What's an altercation abrasion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Like somebody punches you in the eye, you may get a slight, like somebody's knuckles sliding across your face. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>As opposed to your face sliding across the concrete. We rolled him over, there is a little bit of gravel embedded in the wound.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> you testified that the body was prone, what about his face because I mean, was his head turned to one side or the other?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>It was turned facing the left side.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Okay. So it would have been the right side of his face was against the pavement when you saw it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> And that's where the abrasion was?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Or the injuries?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay. The hand on the top of the head is away resting?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, sir.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Anything else? If need be if you think of something else, we can always and it  is directed for we can always bring him back once you have looked at his report, okay?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-alizadeh">
          <p> Or at any time if there is other questions down the road, all you have to do is ask for us to locate a witness.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Did you have something? Just to be clear, the fact that you didn't take pictures, you feel like the county covered whatever pictures you would have supplied yourself?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct. There is not a hole here because you didn't have the pictures?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>All pictures are taken by the police. I would have taken them too. A lot of times we direct them, you know, to take a picture of the back, lift up the shirt, take another picture, roll him over, let's take a picture of the front, lift up the shirt, can you take another picture for me, things of that matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> But in this case you did not do that or did you?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>We did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Oh, you did. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Ask them to take certain pictures?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Oh, okay. All right, anything else?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a">
          <p>They would have done those pictures anyway, it is protocol.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ms-whirley">
          <p> Okay, well, thank you very much. That's it for today.</p>
