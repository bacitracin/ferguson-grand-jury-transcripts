VOLUME I

INTRODUCTION
MR. MCCULLOCH: Thank you. I'm Bob
McCulloch, the Prosecutor, for the record. I want
to talk to you a little bit about this. As you are
well aware of what we are here about and that is the
shooting death of Michael Brown.
I want to tell you how this is going to
proceed. Obviously, it is going to be different
from a lot of the other cases that you've heard,
that you've heard during your term.
First things first. Let me introduce, I
say a lot of this you already know. These two
ladies, for the record, Kathi Alizadeh, Shelia
Whirley, they will be the primary, if not the
exclusive attorneys working in the grand jury on
this case.
Obviously, I hope, obviously, there be a
lot of other people working on things outside of us
getting it ready for the presentation that will be
made by Kathi and/or Sheila.
Kathi was the prosecutor I have on call
for the month of August for all homicide calls. So
she received the call about this shooting within
minutes of the time the County Police were notified
by the Ferguson Police. So she has been working

with the police and lots of other things on this
since the very beginning.
My procedure is always that I have a
prosecutor on call solely for homicide cases and
they stay with that case from start to finish,
whatever that ultimately may be.
Sheila, as you know, has been assigned to
the grand jury for this term and so she will
continue with this grand jury on this case for as
long as it does take.
There are a few things I do want to go
over, first and foremost, to tell you that this is
the first, last and probably the only time I think
that you will see me in relation to this case.
Certainly in the grand jury. Everything that we do,
everything that you do, will be recorded with the
court reporter, who is under the same oath,
essentially, as all the witnesses.
As I said, Kathi and Sheila will be the
primary attorneys, the attorneys responsible for
presenting everything to the grand jury.
Really, I'm going to go over just a few
things to make sure that we have kind of the ground
rules, but the procedure covered.
As you know, your term ends on the lOth of

September. You also have dockets, there is no
docket next week, but on the 3rd and lOth, we have
dockets. Those dockets will be adjusted, but they
won't be canceled. But they will be adjusted to
accommodate whatever time that we need for
presentations on this case.
This case is still in the middle of an
investigation, there is a lot going on and certainly
you are well aware of what's going on in the
evenings and during the day and even out in front of
the courthouse here on occasions.
So there is a lot that is still going on
with the officers gathering the evidence, evidence
is being tested, being evaluated. I say evaluated,
it is being looked at, firearms evidence, the
firearms people are looking at that, DNA evidence,
the DNA are examining that.
In addition, the federal government, U.S.
Department of Justice, is doing a parallel, but an
independent investigation of the same thing.
So a lot of, actually everything pretty
much that the County Police or any other state or
local department is doing is being replicated by the
U.S. Attorney, by the FBI, or by the Justice
Department, they are all part of the Justice

Department.
As that is going back and forth and there
is some witnesses they will be talking to that the
County Police may not necessarily be talking to.
Some that the County had talked to that they haven't
or won't talk to. And so, but all of that will be
traded. We're giving them all the statements we
have, they are passing statements and any other
information that they have on this matter back to
us.
So it is still independent of one another,
but sharing the information because what is
significant to this case is also significant to
theirs. They are looking at different
possibilities.
The federal government and the state
government are not the same. We have these criminal
charges, they look at potential civil rights
violations, but for the same conduct that we are
looking at for any potential criminal violations.
So that may add a little bit, a little bit
of a delay. I really don't want to say a delay, but
kind of giving things to you out of order here
somewhat. Like a trial, lots of information is
going to come to you and it is going to come out of

chronological order. We will kind of go through
that just as a schedule. The schedule is just that.
There will be time if we have a particular
area, just for example, the DNA evidence. If that
is available or when that is available and all of it
is available, not just part of it, we will have the
time that is in the next two weeks to present that
to you all at once. If it is a number of witness
statements, we will present all of those to you. We
will have it all organized and bring it in.
By the time everything is finished, you
will have heard everything, you will have every
statement, there will be as many witnesses to come
in and testify.
If they made statements, you will not only
get the statements they made, whether they are to
police, FBI, or television or on the internet or
anything else. If we've got those statements, you
will have those statements. You will also have the
witness who will come in and testify as to that.
Some certainly might be they are just
statements that are floating around on the internet
and nobody knows who is making that statement, but
everybody is doing that and the FBI is doing what
they can to locate any of those or the source of

them.
So the schedule though after
September lOth, your term is extended, and the only
matter that you will hear anything on will be this
Michael Brown case, the Michael Brown shooting. All
you get is that so you won't have the docket. There
will be another grand jury that starts the week
after that who will be doing what you have been
doing for the past four months.
By the way, greatly appreciate your
service on that. I don't want to lose that in the
message here. You have done a great job, a great
service for the people of this county.
But the schedule will then, it is as
flexible as flexible can be. It is the only matter
that you have and so there is no requirement that
you meet on Wednesdays. So whenever all 12 people
are available, because all the evidence will be
presented to all 12, so we get all 12 of you
together, we will work with everybody's schedule.
Obviously, we want to be as expeditious as
possible, but not rush through it. If that means we
are meeting four hours in the morning and whatever
works is what we are going to do. Saturdays,
evenings, however it works for everybody's schedule,

and as long as you get it. If all 12 of you have an
entire day, we will have an entire day.
If you have four hours sometime, we will
work all of that out, but we will work, obviously,
around your schedules and you know how that's been.
It is a little easier, I suppose, when you could
tell family and employers and the like every
Wednesday you had to be gone. So this will be a
little different, so we will have to coordinate all
of that.
Also, not necessarily a requirement, we do
want to meet here, but there is no requirement of
that. If it turns out to be a Wednesday, then we'll
figure out something on that.
Everything will be recorded. Starting
with the oath by the court reporter and everything
that I'm saying now and everything that anybody
says, whether it is a witness, whether it is one of
the attorneys, or one of the jurors, will be
recorded as we are going along.
The value in the court reporter is that
we're getting at least a rough transcript as we are
going along. So that will, we won't have to wait
six months for all of these tapes to be typed up if
we did it in some other fashion.

The other is that the questions, you know,
unlike a trial jury, you know, you can and have been
discussing what you've heard on perhaps between
witnesses or during breaks and the like. Remind you
that's part of your deliberation and so none of that
happens while there is anybody else in the room and
that includes, of course, the attorney and the court
reporter.
At the end of every witness, the reporter
will make an announcement that essentially he is
going to finalize the disc. For every witness who
testifies and every session of their testimony,
there will be a separate disc made so that when he
finalizes that, what it does is it finalizes the
disc.
After that, it can't be altered, nothing
can be added, nothing can be deleted. And so if
that witness comes back at some other time, there
will be a separate disc for that and we will do the
same. We will do that with every person who comes
in and testifies.
You will have presented to you every bit
of evidence from the photos, from the scene of the
shooting, diagrams of that, the physical evidence
that was seized at the time, at the location, the

DNA evidence, anything and everything that pertains
to this case will be presented to the grand jury.
It will all be available to you for your review as
it is coming in.
Sheila, primarily, will be at least
getting things started in terms of asking the
witness questions, much as you've seen her for the
whole summer doing that.
Jurors, and you're experienced enough now
that you can ask whatever questions you want to ask.
Any item, anything you want to ask any witness,
absolutely ask that information.
If something occurs to you sometime after
that witness is gone, we will get the witness back
at some point and ask those questions again. If
somebody else says something, you need to clarify
it, we will get witnesses back to do whatever it is
that you need done.
The one thing we can't do in terms of
questions, let me back up a little bit on that while
we are talking about the records on that.
Just remember that it is going to take a
few minutes to finalize this disc once that witness
is finished testifying. So if you have discussion,
you want to talk or ask each other questions,

anything at all about that, make sure you wait long
enough that that is finalized and they understand
is out of here and the attorneys out of here.
They will stick around long enough to remind you of
that, wait until everybody is gone before you talk
about it because that's, that's not something that
anybody but the jurors hear.
If you have a question about procedure,
the attorneys will answer that. Who is coming in
next, you know, we are taking a break now or can we
take a break now, anything along the procedure the
attorneys will certainly answer that.
If you have a question about what a
witness said or what is going on or did this witness
say this, they're not going to answer those
questions. If anything, we will get the witness
back to answer any more questions that you asked,
but we are not going to answer those questions.
Just a couple other things. I assume the
judge talked to you this morning, of course, about
your oath, of course, both very similar to what
just took, whatever the witness will take,
that these are confidential proceedings, that
nothing leaves this room unless and until ordered by
the court or some other legal method. I will talk

about those in just a second.
The other is the confidentiality and the
oath and the anonymity. You are anonymous. You are
protected by law from all, your names are not
public, your addresses, no information about you is
public.
There may be some, the demographics of it,
I think that is information that can be passed out
in terms of, you know, race, gender.
MS. ALIZADEH: Age.
MR. MCCULLOCH: I won't say the age. The
general location that we have. Say, I don't know,
three grand jurors who live in municipalities and 12
who live in unincorporated or nine live in
unincorporated. We have X number who are outside of
the 270 loop, X number inside. So many above 70,
below 70, all of that demographic information, but
nothing that would, anybody would ever be able to
identify any individual from just that no matter how
they try to put it together.
And that is, I just want to share, that's
protected by law that's been litigated and those
names, the information does not get released.
So the other is with the parking. We are
trying to arrange the parking very similar to what

we had today so that you are inside. Once we're
past September lOth, you are meeting on a different
schedule, on your schedule, that makes things a lot
easier because, you know, everybody knows that the
grand jury meets on Wednesday.
So if you are meeting some other day, you
know, there may be media around, but the good thing
about construction going on next door is we can kind
of work around the visibility of it, particularly
with the parking that we had. We will have all of
that arranged.
And the media, you know, the media kind of
comes and goes around here. I did a number of
interviews with local people today for a couple
reasons, one is to get it all out of the way. So
we're finished with, for the most part, with any
kind of interviews with that.
I can't control whether anybody shows up
outside and just hangs outside the doors and all of
that. If there is a protest scheduled or the media
is going to be here. We will work with that again.
We will know who is there and what's there and all
of that. If need be, get you in and get you out of
the building without worrying about any of that.
The only other thing I'd say when you are

coming in, don't wear the grand jury badge and that
will, won't tip anybody off that you are on the
grand jury, we will have all of that stuff.
Am I missing anything?
MS. WHIRLEY: Note taking.
MR. MCCULLOCH: Oh, you are right. Note
taking. You take, as you know, all the notes that
you want. Write down anything and everything. If a
thought occurs to you, you want to talk to the
witness, take all the notes that you want. The
notes, of course, can't leave here. They are your
notes and your notes alone.
Fellow grand jurors won't see your notes
and you won't see their notes. At the end of the
day or end of the session, the notes will be
collected and they will be secured. Any evidence
that is presented to you, physical evidence, of
course, also will be collected and it will be
secured. We have highly secure evidence lockers
within the complex here. All of that will be that.
At the end of that, you can use your notes
for any deliberation when everything is finished.
At the end, just so you know, there are going to be
massive amounts of information and physical items
that are coming here in the next month. You're not

going to remember everything. The witness today
testifies, you're not going to remember that a month
from now, but all of that and the transcripts will
all be available and you'll have as long as you
need, as long as you want to go through everything
again before you start your deliberations. While
you are doing deliberations, all of that is
available.
Unlike a trial jury where you have to send
a note out to the judge and the judge would decide
if you get something or you don't get something,
that rule doesn't apply here. Everything will be
here in the room with you and you will have access
to all of it. You, of course, have access to your
notes throughout all of that.
At the end of all of that, you won't have
access to those notes, is that it?
MS. ALIZADEH: I want to say that what Bob
said, everything is going to be recorded in this
room while we're presenting this case. That, of
course, doesn't include your deliberations, those
will not be recorded. And when we have juries who
are hearing evidence in trial, typically the jury,
not typically, always the jury is told prior to
trial to keep an open mind throughout the entire

process, don't form any opinions until you've heard
all of the evidence.
There's no requirement that you all can't
talk about things amongst yourselves. So if there
is something that you all talk about and decide, we
would like to hear from this person or you have a
question about us bringing another witness in, you
all can discuss that amongst yourselves so long as
you are not deliberating and starting to form
opinions until you have heard everything, okay.
So there will be times for you all when
there is no recording going on, where you all can
discuss your schedule, you know, when we might meet
again, and if there's any questions that you have
that you want us to try to provide the answer for.
Again, as Bob said, Sheila and I can't
answer other than just procedural things or
questions of law. But if there is some question
that you have, if we can find somebody who can
answer that question for you, we will do so, we'll
try to bring somebody in to answer those questions,
okay?
MR. MCCULLOCH: I'm glad she said it. You
do need, and I know you will keep an open mind on
everything. You haven't heard a single thing yet

other than what has been in the media, believe me
that's not evidence. Don't form any opinion on
anything that you've heard, good, bad or ugly in the
media.
Everything that's been collected, every
statement that has ever been made, it will all be
here for you. You need to keep that open mind to
give everybody, including the entire community, a
full and as open as it can be, but certainly as
thorough and as expedient of all the evidence that
you can.
I know people keep talking about the
transparency, at the end of all of this, depending
on your determination, as other cases, if there are
charges that you find should be lodged and are
lodged, then all of that information will come out
pursuant to the course of the case. There are rules
that apply then as to how things are handled and all
of that. It doesn't come out right away because you
can't prejudice a potential jury panel. So all of
that evidence, just like here, is presented to a
trial jury in the courtroom and not put out in the
media. So everybody can see it and then make their
mind up before they ever come into a courtroom.
If your determination is that there are no

charges to be filed, then everything will be
released immediately or as close to immediately as
we can get, and that's everything. Your
deliberations aren't, as I said, your deliberations
are not recorded and never will be recorded, notes
won't be released, but every bit of evidence that
you have, the testimony of the witnesses who come
in, the statements of the witnesses, the physical
evidence, the photographs, everything that you have
seen and heard will be released to the public. That
is as transparent as we can get short of putting a
pool TV camera in here and that's not going to
happen.
It is, obviously, an awesome burden, but
it is going to be an awful lot of work and we will
make it as orderly and organized as we can to you.
As I said, if there is anything at all
that we can do to do that, working with your
schedules, work longer, we have no set hours. So
whatever it takes, we will get that to you. We
don't want to rush through anything, but we also
don't want to drag it out.
I'm anticipating, in all honesty, without
basing it on a whole lot, that we hope to have this
completed by the middle of October. It doesn't mean

every day that you will be here from September lOth
until then, but the more days we can have some
session, the more expedient this will get out there
and that's important to everybody, of course.
The most important thing that you get all
the information and all of the evidence and make
your determination on that.
Any questions now, procedure that I can
answer?
Alternate jurors, do we
have them?
MR. MCCULLOCH: We are in the hope that
all 12 of you are perfect, healthy specimens, who
have no plans to leave town or go on vacation for
two months. All 12 will hear everything and the
only way we have alternates is to have them in here
at the time and we do that at a trial, but here it
is just, it doesn't work in the grand jury. So we
have all 12 when we can get all 12 of you together.
If we can only get 11 together, we are
going to have to find a different time. I hope
everybody can be as flexible as possible, and again,
we will be as flexible as possible. We have no set
hours. Every day is Monday, weekends, whatever
works for you is when we are going to be here.

Morning, noon or night, or any day.
Thank you. As I said, this is probably
the last time you will see me. I can't imagine what
it would be unless there is something that came up
that you wanted to see me, so thanks.
MS. ALIZADEH: As Bob said, Sheila and I
are both going to be presenting this case to you and
there may be times where I know Sheila has a case
set for trial next week and it might just be, of
course, we don't have next week. There might be
days where you are only go to see me, only go to see
Sheila, we are trying to split up the work as much
as we can just to make it easier for the both of us,
but there is no, don't read into anything about why
is Sheila only having this witness or Kathi is
presenting this witness because we are just trying
to split it up.
And so on days when Sheila might be
presenting somebody, if I can be, I will also be
here in the room, but I won't be commenting, I won't
be asking any questions, it will be Sheila
presenting, and the same thing on a day where I
might be presenting a witness, Sheila may be here,
but it is just for our benefit. We both want to see
as much and as hear as much as we can, but there

might be times when we are not available.
MR. MCCULLOCH: Good thing about being the
boss is I have a lot of flexibility in adjusting
their schedules, so that will happen, but we will
keep that to a minimum because we want to, in
addition to all 12 of you hearing here, and the two
of them here as much as possible. You will hear
everything, they will hopefully hear everything.
MS. WHIRLEY: I am Sheila Whirley.
Present in the room is Kathi Alizadeh and the
witness, is with the Medical
Examiner's Office. He is the investigator, he is
going to take the oath in a minute and also present
are Jurors 1 through 12.
would you approach to take the
oath?
THE WITNESS: Yes, ma'am.
MS. WHIRLEY: And, of course, the court
reporter, is here.

of lawful age, having been first duly sworn to
testify the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth in the case aforesaid,
deposes and says in reply to oral
interrogatories, propounded as follows, to-wit:
EXAMINATION
MS. WHIRLEY: This proceeding involves the
shooting of Michael Brown.
BY MS. WHIRLEY:
Q All right. you've stated
your name. What is your occupation?
A Medical legal investigator.
Q And where are you employed?
A The St. Louis County Medical Examiner's
Office.
Q How long?
A Approximately 25 years.
Q Now, what does a medical investigator do?
A We investigate the deaths that occur in
St. Louis County.
Q You investigate deaths that occur in St.
Louis County?
A Correct.
Q Do you require any special training for

your job? Let me rephrase that, have you had any
training?
A Yes, I have on-the-job training and
courses that we take.
Q What kind of courses do you take?
A There is a medical legal death
investigating courses, approximately last all week
and
Q So about 40 hours?
A 40 hours.
Q What kind of things are you taught?
A Just how to investigate, what to look for,
what changes in the body after death.
Q You have been doing this for 25 years?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Okay. What kind of schedule do you work
now?
A I work 32 hours a week.
Q And do you work throughout the week or
weekends?
A Just weekends.
Q Only weekends?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q So how many hours, you said 32, so 16 on
Saturday?

A 16 on Saturday and 16 on Sunday.
Q And you were called this particular
Saturday?
A Correct.
Q What was the date of the occurrence?
A I'm not sure.
Q I'm going to give you what's marked for
purposes of identification State's Exhibit Number 1.
And you can refer to this through this proceeding if
you need to tell me what the date was?
A It was the 9th.
Q Okay. The 9th of?
A August.
Q Okay. And I want to talk a little bit
more about your background before we get into the
crux of this.
A Yes, ma'am.
Q What is the purpose of a medical
investigator at a Medical Examiner's Office, why
have you?
A We are the eyes and ears of our
pathologist. The person who is conducting the
autopsy. They don't go to the scenes, we go to the
scenes for them.
Q Okay.

A And bring back information for them so
they can properly do the autopsy.
Q I see. When you go to the scene, do you
have any special tools that you take with you?
A We have cameras and things to establish
the time of death, and other equipment that we
collect evidence.
Q Okay. So tell us what a medical examiner
does once, well, first of all, how do you get the
call?
A Usually a police officer or hospital or
paramedic will call us and let us know there is a
deceased person.
Q Do you have a certain timeframe that you
must follow? I know the person is always deceased
by the time you are called, correct?
A Correct.
Q Are there some time parameters when you
need to arrive to the scene?
A No, ma'am.
Q Okay. So you go by yourself?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Okay. Do you call anyone to come?
A We do have a delivery service that we
call.

Q What is a delivery service?
A Delivery service is the person who picks
up the body.
Q Do you call the delivery service when you
get the call?
A Correct.
Q Once you get there?
A No, once I get the call, I call them to
let them know what is going on, where it is at.
Q They meet you there?
A Right.
Q So at the scene once you arrive, what do
you do? Like take us through an investigation.
A I try to meet the reporting officer, speak
to him, find out what happened. They go and look at
the body and see if everything is consistent with
what he told me or whatever witnesses told him, and
then I come back and I would talk to the family or
one of the witnesses if they were there.
Q So when you talk to people, it is not
necessarily the people who directly saw the
incident?
A Correct.
Q You are getting kind of hearsay
information?

A Yes, ma'am.
Q And you don't necessarily see what is
occurring yourself any of these times?
A Correct.
Q By the time you get there, it has
happened?
A After the fact, correct.
Q Why do you talk to the officers?
A Because the first responding officer makes
contact with the person who called the police to
find out what's going on.
Q Why do you need to know what's going on.
I mean, there is a deceased body, why do you need to
know more?
A To see if the story is consistent with his
death, as opposed to suicide or a homicide, just
trying to establish a timeline.
Q But you are not the one who makes the call
as to what the cause of death is?
A Correct.
Q Or the manner of death?
A Correct.
Q Or whether or not it is a homicide or a
suicide, you don't make that call?
A Correct.

Q You just gather it for the pathologist?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q All right. Do you write a report?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Okay. How long generally does your
investigation take?
A It can take anywhere from several minutes
to an hour or two.
Q Okay. And what's included in your report?
A My initial contact with the reporting
officer, the reporting person, the location, what I
saw when I got there, the condition of the body, and
a paragraph or two on witness statements.
Q Who is your supervisor, who do you report
to?
A Chief Investigator
Q Who would approve your report, is that the
same person?
A He would.
Q All right. Do you generally take
photographs?
A Yes.
Q Okay. And let's talk specifically about
the case involving the shooting of Michael Brown.
Did you take photographs?

A No, ma'am.
Q Why not?
A My battery in my camera died.
Q Were photographs being taken?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q By whom?
A St. Louis County Police Department.
Q Like their identification unit?
A Their identification unit, correct.
Q You saw them taking photographs?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Do you have access to those photographs?
A If we need them, we can get them.
Q Is that something you would want,
photographs?
A Sometimes the pathologist asks for them.
Q Okay. Do you know if they were asked for
in this case?
A I don't know.
Q Okay. I thought I heard you say, or if
you didn't, let me ask the question, did you take
measurements of anything?
A Yes, we can if we need to, yes.
Q Did you in this case?
A No, ma'am.

Q Because you didn't need to?
A Correct.
Q Why not?
A I got there, it was self-explanatory what
happened. Somebody shot somebody. There was no
question as to any distances or anything of that
nature at the time I was there.
Q Okay. And if it turns out there was some
concern about the distances, that's not something
that you would be qualified to tell us about?
A If I took the measurements I could tell
you about them.
Q What kind of distances when you say
distance?
A Like for the Brown case?
Q Uh-huh.
A Maybe like if he was close enough to leave
stippling on his clothing, things of that nature.
Q So you didn't take any measurements
though?
A Correct, I didn't see no stippling, no
indication how close he actually was going to be.
Q Did you look for stippling?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Where did you look for it at?

A Around the wounds.
Q Wounds?
A Yes.
Q When you say stippling, what is stippling?
A It is gunpowder, burning of the gun
powder.
Q You say you looked for it around his
wounds?
A Correct.
Q And what did you see?
A I didn't see any.
Q Okay. So this occurred on, tell us the
date again?
A Uh
Q I'm sorry?
A The 9th.
Q The 9th of?
A August.
Q Of August?
A August 9th.
Q What time were you told this occurred?
A Our office got the initial call at 1:30.
Q Did you get information that it occurred
earlier than 1:30?
A Yes, ma'am.

Q What time is that?
A Around noon time.
Q Okay. So it occurred around noon time.
You get the call around 1:30?
A Correct.
Q And the call comes from St. Louis County?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Do you know who called?
A
Q
A
Q Did you talk to that person?
A No, I didn't.
Q So someone gave you the assignment?
A Correct. No wait, I'm sorry, I did talk
to him.
Q You did?
A Yeah, the initial call came into our on
duty investigator, he gave me the information and I
called the sergeant.
Q What did you call him for?
A To set up a time when they need me, when
to actually be out there.
Q Okay.
A Go ahead.

Q Why did you need to set up a time?
A Because other officers are responding to
the scene, St. Louis County detectives, their ID
unit, that may take anywhere from 30 minutes to
several hours before I could actually get in and
actually see the body.
Q So you don't want to be there when they
are doing their thing?
A Correct.
Q Okay. And so you were called at 1:30.
And what time did you arrive?
A Approximately 1430, 2:30.
Q That's 2:30. In about an hour. Is there
any reason why it took you an hour to arrive?
A No, ma'am, just waited. I called them
about 2:15, they said they were showing up, the ID
people were there showing up. So I went ahead and
responded to the scene.
Q You were giving them time to do what they
needed to do?
A Correct.
Q So describe the scene to us when you
arrived. I mean, like were there a lot of people
out?
A It was an apartment complex where crime

scene tape up, and a crowd has gathered, quite a few
people there. He was deceased, was laying in the
middle of the street. There was already some orange
barriers around him to keep the crowd from seeing
him.
Q Was the crowd saying anything?
A They were just, I don't know how to
explain it. I guess voicing their concerns at what
is going on, why is this taking so long, things of
that nature.
Q Why is it taking so long?
A Correct.
Q And you could discern what they were
saying?
A I hear them, but I don't listen.
Q But you did know they were asking why it's
taking so long?
A Yes.
Q Do you know what that meant?
A I assume the body was laying out there too
long, they didn't like the body being out there.
Q When you arrived, tell us what it looked
like, the body, was it covered, uncovered?
A He was covered with several white sheets
laying in the prone position.

Q Prone means?
A Face down. There is a double yellow line,
I guess it is east and west traffic, he was right in
the middle of the roadway.
Q Okay. What did you do?
A When I was able to go to the body?
Q Yes.
A I went over there with the police
officers, the ID officers, we removed the sheets,
took photographs of his back, lifted up the shirt,
took more photographs. Then we rolled him over, I
placed white clean sheets down on the ground and
rolled him over onto those. Took more photographs,
documented the injuries, looked through his pockets,
looked through his pants for any weapons or anything
of that nature.
And then got some clean paper bags,
placed them on his hands and then we put him back on
the sheet and into a white bag and sealed it up.
Q How long were you on the scene?
A Probably a couple hours.
Q And when you left, the body left, the
deceased left; is that right?
A Correct.
Q You --

A I was actually with the body for about 15,
20 minutes by the time I was waiting to get to the
body.
Q You were there, you think, a total of a
couple hours?
A Correct.
Q Did you talk to any of the bystanders or
people that were not police officers?
A Just his grandmother.
Q Tell us about that.
A I was walking back to my vehicle to make
some phone calls and a lady came up and she asked me
if I was a medical examiner, I told her I was. She
asked me why the body was still on the street, why
is it taking so long.
I explained to her, you know, it
takes a thorough investigation and crowd control,
just getting everybody into the scene was taking
time to do that and once everybody is here, we can
get our information that we need and the evidence
collected and then we can be out of here. Once
everything starts, it doesn't take long.
Q Okay.
A She seemed to be fine with that, and she
said she is going to walk around the crowd and try

to get people to move back.
Q She did?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q She was very pleasant --
A Yes, ma'am.
Q -- with you? Did you notice his mother
there?
A The officer pointed his mother out in the
crowd.
Q Did you have any conversation with her?
A No, ma'am.
Q Did she do anything or say anything that
you overheard?
A Not really, just crying hysterically and
oh, my God, and stuff like that.
Q Was there anything about his tattoo?
A There was an officer stated that she said
he had a tattoo on his arm, Big Mike, that is one of
the things we need to do is get him identified.
I actually didn't know if she
actually walked over there and actually seen him, or
she just knows that's him and explained the tattoo.
When we rolled him over, we saw the tattoo and knew
it was him.
Q You overheard, or an officer told you that

that's what she said?
A Correct.
Q That he had a tattoo Big Mike?
A Correct.
Q Then you verified the tattoo?
A Correct. We can use tattoos for
identification in our office.
Q Now, when you said you rolled over the
body and you checked the body for injuries and
photos were taken, you didn't take those photos, you
know photos were taken?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Can you describe the injuries as you saw
them?
A I saw one in the top of the head, several
on his right eye, a bunch of blood, dried up blood.
I guess road material, there was one here, there was
an injury here, an injury on his side right here,
two in the arm and one in here and a wound on his
hand.
Q Did you see any wounds to his back?
A No, ma'am.
Q When you say he was laying prone, which is
face down, where was his hands and that kind of
thing?

A He was prone and his left hand was under
him and his right arm was slightly out to his side.
Q Could you stand up for me?
A If I stood up and I was laying down it
would be like this. (indicating)
Q So his right hand was where?
A On the ground, slightly away from his
back.
Q Okay. And his left hand was where?
A More like by his waistband, in front of
him.
Q On his side as he is laying, not outside
his body?
A No, like he fell on it, right.
Q Okay. Did he have any weapons?
A No, ma'am.
Q You checked him for weapons; is that
right?
A Correct.
Q Did you happen to speak to the officer who
was charged, who is not charged, but who is alleged
who did the shooting?
A No, ma'am.
Q Okay. He wasn't at the scene when you got
there?

A Correct.
Q Okay. Any other bystanders come up to you
or say anything?
A No, ma'am.
Q Okay. Were you frightened or afraid?
A No, ma'am.
Q Okay. Now, you said you talked to the
police, they gave you information about what
happened?
A Correct.
Q And this isn't any firsthand account that
you have, you did ask them what happened?
A Correct.
Q Who did you talk to?
A Detective , was one of the
detectives.
Q And what did he say?
A That there was a, that Officer Wilson was
driving down the roadway, he encountered the two
individuals in the street, asked them to exit the
street and an altercation started from there. And
the decedent ran away from the vehicle, the officer
gave chase. They met up again in the middle of the
roadway and shots were fired.
Q Okay. And did Detective

represent to you that he actually saw this occur?
A No, rna' am, he wasn't there.
Q I'm sorry?
A No, he did not see it.
Q He is telling you what he heard?
A Correct, information he received from
whoever he ended up hearing it.
Q Do you know who that was?
A No, ma'am.
Q Were there any paramedics at the scene
when you arrived?
A No, ma'am, they were already gone.
Q And when discussing the body again,
Michael Brown, was it like firm or hard, or tell us
about rigor mortis, what is rigor mortis?
A Rigor mortis is hardening of the muscles
after death.
Q Okay. When does that set in?
A It starts immediately, but you actually,
full rigor mortis about 12 hours after death.
Q Okay.
A Then it goes away and it comes back. Many
different variables, different size of people, where
they're at, location of the body, what they were
doing prior.

Q Weather?
A Medications, weather, drugs, everything.
Q Did you notice any rigor mortis on Michael
Brown?
A It was starting to set in, correct.
Q Where?
A I felt it in his arms, his hands.
Q Okay. Do you know whether or not he had
been moved or anything when you arrived?
A It didn't look like he was moved from the
position that he was --
Q You don't ask that question?
A We do ask that question. Sometimes we can
tell if the body has been moved.
Q How?
A By livor mortis.
Q What is that?
A Settling of the blood.
Q How can you tell by the livor mortis?
Explain.
A Actually, with light skin people you can
see it, in dark skin people it is hard to see.
Q Okay.
A That's why I didn't put that in the report
as to livor mortis.

Q What do you see? I don't understand.
A It is when your blood starts, all the
blood just settles at the lowest part and gravity
takes over and all the blood comes down here and
this would be like discolored.
Q Okay.
A Anywhere from like a light pink to a dark
blue, and that sets in about 12 hours. If you move
somebody, it will change position.
Q Oh. And it was based on your training and
experience and your discussion with the officers he
had not been moved?
A Correct.
Q All right. When you got there, did the
police delay you or tell you, you know, they weren't
ready for you to do your part or did you get right
in?
A No, I didn't get right in, they still had
some photographs to take and evidence to collect and
document.
Q So once you got there, I know you said it
took you about 15 minutes to do what you needed to
do, but once you got there, how long did you wait
before you were able to do what you needed to do
would you say?

A I would guess about an hour.
Q Okay. Is that unusual?
A No, ma'am, not for homicides, no.
Q Okay. Now, did you take any notes
regarding what was occurring?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Okay. Is that your regular system that
you take notes as you are out on the scene?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q And you use those notes to write your
report?
A Correct.
Q How soon do you write your report?
A As soon as I get back to the office.
Q Is that what you did in this case?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Okay. What do you do with those notes?
A I usually destroy them after the report is
completed.
Q You shred them?
A Yes.
Q Did you do that in this case?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Why do you shred them?
A Everything in my report is going to be

from my notes.
Q Okay. Is there stuff that you did not put
in your notes that you want to tell us about or that
you did not put in the report?
A Other than?
Q Anything?
A In looking at the report, I would like to
clarify, the east and west position of the body may
not be accurate, may not be correct. I was just
going by the street that I came in on, that I came
down. It should have been an east and west street.
So that should have been west and his feet should
have been east.
Sometimes in a subdivision the
streets, they curve, so his head may be a little bit
off. Like southwest, and his feet may be northeast
or something in a different report, but I should say
that the head was pointing towards Florissant and
his feet was, what's the name of the other street,
the other main intersection that I came in on to get
to Canfield.
Q Okay.
A I can't think of the street right now.
Q Okay. Is there anything else looking at
your report that you need to modify or add?

A Not that I can think of.
Q When you are writing your report, if there
is something that you discover later, do you write a
supplemental?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Can you recall an instance where you did
write a supplemental? You don't have to tell us the
name of the case or anything.
A Cases like, maybe on this kind of case
like this, maybe the doctor asked us what was he
doing before this happened. I would have to go
back, contact an officer, maybe his family and find
out why he was with so and so doing something or you
know, whatever he was doing prior to his death. I
may have to go back and get that information.
They may call me, the doctor may ask
me, can you call the family to see if they have any
kind of medical history, and things of that nature.
Q Okay. And getting back again because one
other thing I want to ask you about the injuries,
did you count the gunshot wounds?
A Yes, ma'am, what I thought was gunshot
wounds.
Q Clarify what you mean?
A Just because there is a hole in a person

doesn't actually mean it came from a bullet.
Q Okay.
A It could be a stabbing, could have fallen
on a rock, could be a laceration.
Q But you counted a certain amount of wounds
that may or may not have been gunshot wounds?
A Correct.
Q How many did you count?
A I think nine altogether, nine.
Q Where were they located, you can tell us?
Refer to your report.
A One on top of the head, one to the right
forehead, one around the eye, and then one in the
neck, close to the neck/chest area, one on the right
side and the rest in the arm and one in the hand.
Q Okay. You said total like nine?
A Correct, nine injuries.
Q Did he have any other abrasions to his
body?
A He had abrasions on the back of his hand,
left hand and abrasion on the right side of his
face.
Q What is an abrasion?
A Several scratches.
Q And when you were done, you said you

wrapped him up in a clean sheet?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q And then you told delivery person, what
did you tell them to do?
A We work as a team. And I roll them over
and I put them in a sheet, we tie them up and lift
him up, put him in bag, seal up the bag. Actually,
just zip it. We have a lock that we put on there
and the lock stays on there until the next day.
Q Okay.
A And then the delivery service, the two
people will pick up the body, put it on a cot and
transport it back to the facility.
Q To the Medical Examiner's Office?
A Correct.
Q Did you go back to the office too?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q When they were packaging Michael Brown and
putting him in the delivery, the car, I guess it is
like a hearse or something?
A It is an Escalade.
Q An Escalade. Did anybody say anything as
you are leaving or did the mom come up to you?
A No, we were inside the crime scene tape,
nobody was actually able to come up to the vehicle.

Q Okay. All right. Questions?
MS. ALIZADEH: Can I ask a couple?
Q (By Ms. Alizadeh) Shortly after, at some
point, and I assume quickly you learned that this
was a police officer shooting, correct?
A Correct.
Q Do you handle those any differently than
you do other scene shootings?
A No, ma'am.
Q The entire time you were there, there was
police officers present, correct?
A Correct.
Q From St. Louis County?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Were there any Ferguson officers present?
A There was multiple different jurisdictions
there.
Q Okay. At any time did anyone, whether it
is a police officer or anyone else, did you feel
that they were preventing you from doing your job
the way you thought it should be done?
A No, ma'am.
Q Did anybody suggest that you do something
that you would not have normally done?

A No, ma'am.
Q Did, and you said that this was obviously
a shooting, you would not have handled this any
differently if it was a nonpolice related shooting?
A Correct.
Q And then also you said that you checked
the body of Michael Brown and you checked in his
pockets and you were looking for weapons, a weapon?
A Correct.
Q Did you have reason to believe that there
was a weapon or is that a standard thing?
A Standard procedures.
Q Okay. Did you find anything in his
pockets?
A We found two lighters, two $5 bills and a
small little bag of marijuana, or what appeared to
be marijuana. It was a green substance, grass,
looks like marijuana to me.
Q Okay.
A That was it.
Q And when you say we found, who is the we?
A Actually, it was me taking the stuff out
of the pockets, detectives were standing there
taking notes, the ID people were standing there,
they should have taken photographs of it. After we

were done, I put it back in the pocket.
Q You were the one who actually reached into
the pockets?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q To your knowledge, were you the first
person to go into those pockets or do you know if
there was anybody else?
A I couldn't answer that one.
Q You don't ask or make any attempt to ask
if someone --
A We do, we do ask if anybody went in there
and got his cell phone out. Sometimes they take the
wallet out to get his ID out or take the cell phone
to get information off the phone, and that wasn't
done.
Q To your knowledge?
A To my knowledge it wasn't done.
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay, that's it.
When you got there, you
said you were taking photographs and I understand
you weren't actually taking them, were you directing
the police on what photographs to take?
A No, ma'am.
You were relying on them
to take the actual photographs?

A Correct.
You said injuries, how
many were down the right side?
A Just one injury on the right side, right
below his nipple, one right here, clavicle area.
You said the forehead,
the eye, the neck, the side, the hand, the arm and
the hand?
A Correct. And one in the top of the head
too.
And the position of the
body, I didn't quite hear because I'm opposite from
you. When looking at you, you said one arm was out,
was that the right arm?
A Right arm was out.
Right arm was out and the
left arm was against his waistband?
A Correct, yes, ma'am.
And you modified the
direction of the body. Can you say again was it
east or the west or the west to east?
A I'm going to assume his head was west and
his feet was east.
His head was west and his
feet were east and that's the modification?

A That's what I have in my report, I just
want to make sure I clarify that his head actually
faced West Florissant and his feet was Glen Oak,
Glen Oak was the other street.
So his face was at West
Florissant?
A Correct.
And his feet were at Glen
Oak?
A Correct.
Was he face down?
A Yes, ma'am.
MS. WHIRLEY: When you say modify, this is
Sheila Whirley, you are talking about your report,
not that you did anything to that body to change the
position of the body?
A No, ma'am.
MS. WHIRLEY: Your modification is to make
a correction in your report?
A Yes. Like an officer comes up with a
compass, it is northwest by southeast or it is east
and west, you know, or south and north, I just want
to clarify myself. I was trying to figure out where
I was at by the street location.
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay, I see.

A Came down Chambers, which is east and west
and Glen Oak is going north and south and right back
onto Campfield.
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay yes, ma'am.
A Yes, ma'am.
I'm trying to get a
clarification. You said that the police officers
had already examined the body, photoing the body,
taking pictures of everything on the body.
Let me understand, when you examined the
body, you searched the pockets and you found the
marijuana, the two $5 bills and the two lighters.
Why wouldn't those objects be outside the pockets if
they had already examined the body?
A They don't actually examine, they just
take photographs. They don't touch the body until I
get there and I can't touch the body until the
detectives get there. We kind of do it in tandem.
We don't want to disturb the scene. They come in
and they photograph everything like it is. I come
in, if I move anything, then they photograph it
again.
MS. WHIRLEY: What's the purpose of doing
it in tandem and not the police?

A That way the scene doesn't get
contaminated, things get moved around or kicked
around and we all have different information then.
MS. WHIRLEY: There is information that
the body may be able to tell the medical examiner or
should be able to tell a medical examiner?
A Right.
MS. WHIRLEY: And if it is tampered with,
that information --
A Correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: May not be accurate?
A May be important information.
MS. WHIRLEY:
I just need a
clarification here. This is in regards to your
conversation with Sergeant ?
A Correct.
Approximately 1:30 p.m.
you had a conversation with him to set up a time
when you were to arrive at the scene?
A Yes, ma'am.
Q Okay. And you said approximately, he said
you called within an hour of that time?
A Correct.
Q So approximately 1:30 p.m. to 2:30p.m.,

you called, but you said you arrived at the scene at
about 2:30 approximately your time. Now, I
understand you stated that after you got to the
scene then you had to wait another hour, is that my
understanding?
A Yes, ma'am, approximately about another
hour.
So actually your
investigation didn't start until about 3:30 p.m.
that day?
A Correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: So what was happening in
that hour?
A What happens, the crime scene unit they
show up, they have to get their cameras ready to
make their placards, grab all of their little place
cards and find evidence on the scene, mark the
evidence, lay it there, take photographs of it.
A lot of time you have to clear out a
way, a path for me to get to the body. I'll be
walking through there kicking shell casings and
different evidence around.
MS. WHIRLEY: So all of that was
occurring?
A That was going on then, correct. Like I

said, they just got there, they are talking amongst
themselves on what they are going to do. There is
several officers. Some transcribe, some give out
measurements, some photograph, you have a
transcriber with the photographer.
MS. WHIRLEY: This was St. Louis County on
the scene?
A Correct, yes, ma'am.
MS. WHIRLEY: It is your understanding
that Ferguson was on the scene first?
A Correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: And then the scene was
turned over to St. Louis County?
A Yes, ma'am.
MS. WHIRLEY: Yes, sir.
Were paramedics
called initially do you know to, you know, the first
instance, did they do anything to the body?
A I don't know if they were called or not.
I know they arrived on scene shortly after it
happened. I looked at the body, they didn't have no
leads, any kind of what they usually do is put a
lead on their body for EKGs to see if there is any
kind of heartbeats. None of that was placed on
there. Everything from there on is going to be

assumption. I don't want to assume what they did.
Who would determine before
you got there this person was deceased?
A The paramedics or police officer, I don't
know.
MS. WHIRLEY: When you got there, the body
was deceased?
A Correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: Michael Brown was deceased?
A Yes, ma'am.
To just continue that, to
put the EKG on to determine that, do they typically
have to move the body?
A No. I guess from the wounds that they
observed was actually a fatal wound.
MS. WHIRLEY:
So in 25 years
of work, how common when you have responded at the
scene for a shooting involved an officer and another
civilian, is that something that happens often?
A I have been on several of them.
So several of them in 25
years?
A Several police shootings.
So in this case, did it

seem peculiar or out of the ordinary that the
shooting officer was not present?
A No, not at all.
Not at all?
A No.
Do you know what the
protocol is for that?
A They probably took him to the hospital or
back to the police station interviews. Majority of
the time, they're not there.
MS. WHIRLEY:
MS. ALIZADEH: Could I make a suggestion?
I know you all aren't used to this, but when you do
ask a question because we don't know how well this
is all picking up until we listen to this later or
have an opportunity to check it, so if you would
make, you don't have to get right up on it, but make
an effort to kind of speak into the microphone so
that we can be sure that your questions are
recorded, that would be great. If I see you not
doing that because you are not used to it, I might
say, could you get close to the mike, okay.
MS. WHIRLEY: Let me just say, this is
your mike, we are kind of sharing it, just to let
you know.

You said, I
guess, you looked for gun powder on the body?
A Yes, sir.
And you didn't find any?
A Correct.
If you would have found
some, what does that determine?
A That tells me that the weapon was fired at
a certain distance from the body.
So usually you can tell
the closeness, I guess?
A Correct. If the altercation was maybe
12 inches or less when the gun fired.
MS. ALIZADEH: Just for the sake of
clarification, you're not a ballistics expert?
A Correct, I'm not a ballistics expert.
MS. ALIZADEH: There if you would like, we
anticipate you may hear evidence as this goes along
about that, but he's not an expert in ballistics.
A Depends on weapon, age of the weapon.
MS. ALIZADEH: He can talk about his
experiences and what he knows from his personal and
professional training, but he's not really a
ballistics expert.
He asked a question that

led to another question.
A Sure.
You said there were no
leads on the body by paramedics?
A Correct.
Are you able to see that
after they leave?
A Yes, ma'am, they are small stickers.
So they don't take those
off?
A No.
They would be on there?
A Correct.
You were able to see?
A I didn't see any on there.
They didn't even --
A Correct.
MS. ALIZADEH: One other suggestion, try
to refrain from using each other names just for
again, for your sakes and for the anonymity part of
it.
We can have the court reporter redact that
out. But of course, you know, it is on disc. This
is all new to us, so we are learning as we go.
MS. WHIRLEY: Anything else?

MS. ALIZADEH: Don't be afraid to ask a
question because I've been kind of making
suggestions. I don't want to intimidate anybody
into, I don't want to ask a question because I think
Kathi might yell at me. But if there is any, any
other questions for this witness.
You don't see
any gun power or anything on his clothes, that
doesn't mean when the gun went off, he couldn't
find, he couldn't find that?
A Correct.
He could find that on
other clothes?
A Correct. He may find some and he may not
find some.
Will we get a
copy of your report? I'd like to see the report.
MS. WHIRLEY: Yes. It is Exhibit Number
1. We will have that with your notes whenever you
are ready to look at it, you can.
Anything else?
Are there any
other things besides the wounds that you are looking
at or documenting as you are looking at this
particular body before you transport it or is it

just the wounds itself you are looking at?
A I look at the whole body overall.
Okay.
A Position of the clothing, wounds, if it's
a female, fingernails, everything from the top of
the head down to the bottom of his feet we look at.
Typically do you, when you
file a report outside of this prior to this
particular case, would you typically file
photographs with your report?
A Yes, sir.
And then with regard to
this specific case, are you anticipating getting
those photos and filing with your report?
A My own photos that I would take on the
scene I would print out and be with my report.
Okay.
A But the police photos, the police have
those, but we can request those if we need them.
Okay. Are you
anticipating
A Or pathologist, I don't know the
pathologist --
MS. WHIRLEY: You will see those photos.

I'm just wondering is he
anticipating to get those photos to file with your
report?
A They don't get filed with our report.
Okay, all right.
Now, you said
that you didn't take photos yourself, you said that
you didn't take photos yourselves?
A Correct.
Upon arriving at the scene
as the batteries had died in your camera?
A Yes, ma'am.
All right. So I mean, is
there some protocol with your department that you
have to have your camera charged up all times?
A No, ma'am.
Just to alleviate this
type of thing happening?
A No, ma'am.
So right now we only have
the photos that St. Louis County or whatever --
A Correct.
-- did? Okay.
A Correct. My photographs would have been
him laying on the ground with the sheets over him,

removing the sheets and his back, you know, the
whole body.
Uh-huh.
A And maybe that's it.
Okay.
A Anywhere from two to four pictures, no
more than that. Just trying to give the pathologist
a picture of what's going on when this person died.
Okay.
Did you notice
any other wounds on the body hands wise?
A Just the abrasion on the back of the left
hand and abrasion on his face and nothing really
obvious.
MS. ALIZADEH: And just to
clarify, you said your job is to document the body?
A Correct.
MS. ALIZADEH: As you find it and you also
make a determination if you believe the body has
been moved, was there any reason for you to believe
that the body was moved in this case?
A No, ma'am.
MS. ALIZADEH: Now is it your job to look
at anything around the body, whether it be blood
splatters or shell casings?

A Yes, ma'am.
MS. ALIZADEH: Do you make notes of that?
A Yes.
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. And in your report,
did you make those notes?
A No, ma'am.
MS. ALIZADEH: All right. But did you, do
you recall making notes about any blood around the
body?
A Nothing in the reports, no.
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay.
MS. WHIRLEY: Did you see any shell
casing?
A There were numerous shell casings on the
scene.
MS. WHIRLEY: But you didn't put that in
your report?
A Correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: Why not?
A At the time where they were at and they
were still being processed, I guess let the police
take care of that part. They are trying to figure
out what shots were fired and what order, I didn't
see no reason to see where they were at.
Wouldn't the

shells kind of determine how the body was shot, what
angle, how far, the distance?
A They could at times.
MS. WHIRLEY: That's not what you are
qualified to figure out?
A Correct. I don't know if they were moved,
kicked around, people trampled through there, things
of that nature. And the semiautomatic weapon, are
the shell casings going to go out to the right side
and eject.
MS. ALIZADEH: And so your
purpose in being there and your function is to
assist the medical examiner in doing their job?
A Yes, ma'am.
MS. ALIZADEH: You're not there as a
police agent or an agent of any police department?
A Correct. As a matter of fact, my mission
is just for the body.
MS. ALIZADEH: Just for the medical
examiner?
A Correct.
Whose
responsibility is it to write the whole report
overview of that at the scene, is that the police
department? Obviously, it is not this individual.

A Police department.
MS. ALIZADEH: I anticipate you will be
hearing testimony from the investigators who do
document the crime scene in any kind of crime scene
and especially such as this, there is going to be
probably a number of officers who were doing
different things at the crime scene to process the
scene.
A This crime scene, can I say something?
The crime scene was huge, he's here, some of his
shoes are farther away from him. You have a vehicle
and his hat, it may stretch out 100 yards. I'm just
there for the body. Just trying to let our
pathologist know he's here, there are other things
there, this is what's going on with the body.
MS. WHIRLEY: It is your job to take the
body when you leave?
A Correct. And the police will come in and
photograph everything else, document it where it is
at and take their notes.
MS. WHIRLEY:
You mentioned
before that when you arrived at the scene and you
saw the body for the first time, he was in the
middle of the road, is that my understanding?

A Yes, ma'am.
This road that he's on, is
this like one lane each direction?
A Two lanes.
Two lanes each side.
Okay. So you have the center yellow dividing line?
A Yes, ma'am.
Where was he in
conjunction to that dividing line, was he right on
it?
A Yeah, right on the line.
Was it bisecting him or
dissecting?
A It was dissecting.
MS. WHIRLEY: The cars were able to drive
around him?
A I'm sorry?
MS. WHIRLEY: Were cars able to drive
around him?
A I would think so. By the time I got
there, crime scene tape was already up.
MS. WHIRLEY: Preventing anyone from
driving?
A Correct.
I hate to

keep going back to the injuries. I want to make
sure I got this right, top of head, forehead, eye,
neck, arm, side and hand, that's not nine.
A One on top of the head, two in the eyes,
three in the head.
Three in the head?
A Yes, three in the head. I'm calling the
face the head.
Okay. So top of the
head, forehead and eye are three.
A Two in the chest.
Two in the chest.
A Which I'm calling from the neckline down
to the waistline and his arm had one in the upper
bicep.
Okay.
A One closer to the middle of the arm --
There were two in the
arm?
A Actually three, and then one in the
forearm.
Three in the arm and one
in the hand.
A Correct.
So a total of four in

this extremity?
A Correct.
You don't say
there were nine, it could be come in here and come
out here?
A Correct, it is nine wounds.
It is nine wounds.
A Correct.
No nine shots?
A No, nine wounds.
MS. WHIRLEY: And just to be clear, you
don't know whether those are entrance, exit,
abrasions, you can't say?
A At the time I couldn't say, correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: Can you say now?
A The medical report is done.
MS. WHIRLEY: I mean, that's not your
report though?
A Correct. The doctor report is completed
and he determined exits and entrances.
MS. WHIRLEY: A medical examiner could
say?
A Correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: You can't say?
A I could say.

MS. WHIRLEY: From firsthand experience
can you tell us?
A I can tell an entrance and exit.
MS. WHIRLEY: Can you tell us what the
wounds were.
A But on these I couldn't, that's why I
didn't.
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay.
The abrasions
that you noticed, were they consistent with where he
would have made contact when he hit the ground with
his forehead and left hand or could that have been
caused by some earlier altercation or something.
A To me it looked like it came from the
ground, that is more of an assumption.
MS. WHIRLEY: Why does it look like it
came from the ground?
A Because it looked more like a road rash
abrasion as opposed to an altercation abrasion, like
somebody scratching him.
MS. WHIRLEY: What's an altercation
abrasion.
A Like somebody punches you in the eye, you
may get a slight, like somebody's knuckles sliding
across your face.

MS. WHIRLEY: Okay.
A As opposed to your face sliding across the
concrete. We rolled him over, there is a little bit
of gravel embedded in the wound.
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay.
MS. ALIZADEH: you testified
that the body was prone, what about his face because
I mean, was his head turned to one side or the
other?
A It was turned facing the left side.
MS. ALIZADEH: Okay. So it would have
been the right side of his face was against the
pavement when you saw it?
A Yes, ma'am.
MS. WHIRLEY: And that's where the
abrasion was?
A Correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: Or the injuries?
A Yes, ma'am.
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay.
The hand on the top of the
head is away resting?
A Yes, sir.
MS. WHIRLEY: Anything else? If need be
if you think of something else, we can always and it

is directed for we can always
bring him back once you have looked at his report,
okay?
MS. ALIZADEH: Or at any time if there is
other questions down the road, all you have to do is
ask for us to locate a witness.
MS. WHIRLEY: Did you have something?
Just to be
clear, the fact that you didn't take pictures, you
feel like the county covered whatever pictures you
would have supplied yourself?
A Correct.
There is not a hole here
because you didn't have the pictures?
A All pictures are taken by the police. I
would have taken them too. A lot of times we direct
them, you know, to take a picture of the back, lift
up the shirt, take another picture, roll him over,
let's take a picture of the front, lift up the
shirt, can you take another picture for me, things
of that matter.
MS. WHIRLEY: But in this case you did not
do that or did you?
A We did.
MS. WHIRLEY: Oh, you did.

A Correct.
MS. WHIRLEY: Ask them to take certain
pictures?
A Yes, ma'am.
MS. WHIRLEY: Oh, okay. All right,
anything else?
A They would have done those pictures
anyway, it is protocol.
MS. WHIRLEY: Okay, well, thank you very
much. That's it for today.
