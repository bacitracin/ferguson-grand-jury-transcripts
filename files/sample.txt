I want 4 to talk to you a little bit about this. As you are 5 well aware of what we are here about and that is the 6 shooting death of Michael Brown. 7 I want to tell you how this is going to 8 proceed. Obviously, it is going to be different 9 from a lot of the other cases that you've heard, 10 that you've heard during your term. 11 First things first. Let me introduce, I 12 say a lot of this you already know. These two 13 ladies, for the record, Kathi Alizadeh, Shelia 14 Whirley, they will be the primary, if not the 15 exclusive attorneys working in the grand jury on 16 this case. 17 Obviously, I hope, obviously, there be a 18 lot of other people working on things outside of us 19 getting it ready for the presentation that will be 20 made by Kathi and/or Sheila. 21 Kathi was the prosecutor I have on call 22 for the month of August for all homicide calls. So 23 she received the call about this shooting within 24 minutes of the time the County Police were notified 25 by the Ferguson Police. So she has been working Gore Perry Reporting and Video FAX 314-241-6750 314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com d5c6c720-281 b-4bd3-b556-f277 df197 ecc

Darren Wilson Grand Jury August 20, 2014 Page 6 1 with the police and lots of other things on this 2 since the very beginning. 3 My procedure is always that I have a 4 prosecutor on call solely for homicide cases and 5 they stay with that case from start to finish, 6 whatever that ultimately may be. 7 Sheila, as you know, has been assigned to 8 the grand jury for this term and so she will 9 continue with this grand jury on this case for as 10 long as it does take. 11 There are a few things I do want to go 12 over, first and foremost, to tell you that this is 13 the first, last and probably the only time I think 14 that you will see me in relation to this case. 15 Certainly in the grand jury. Everything that we do, 16 everything that you do, will be recorded with the 17 court reporter, who is under the same oath, 18 essentially, as all the witnesses. 19 As I said, Kathi and Sheila will be the 20 primary attorneys, the attorneys responsible for 21 presenting everything to the grand jury. 22 Really, I'm going to go over just a few 23 things to make sure that we have kind of the ground 24 rules, but the procedure covered. 25 As you know, your term ends on the lOth of Gore Perry Reporting and Video FAX 314-241-6750 314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com d5c6c720-281 b-4bd3-b556-f277 df197 ecc

You also have dockets, there is no 2 docket next week, but on the 3rd and lOth, we have 3 dockets. Those dockets will be adjusted, but they 4 won't be canceled. But they will be adjusted to 5 accommodate whatever time that we need for 6 presentations on this case. 7 This case is still in the middle of an 8 investigation, there is a lot going on and certainly 9 you are well aware of what's going on in the 10 evenings and during the day and even out in front of 11 the courthouse here on occasions. 12 So there is a lot that is still going on 13 with the officers gathering the evidence, evidence 14 is being tested, being evaluated. I say evaluated, 15 it is being looked at, firearms evidence, the 16 firearms people are looking at that, DNA evidence, 17 the DNA are examining that. 18 In addition, the federal government, U.S. 19 Department of Justice, is doing a parallel, but an 20 independent investigation of the same thing. 21 So a lot of, actually everything pretty 22 much that the County Police or any other state or 23 local department is doing is being replicated by the 24 U.S. Attorney, by the FBI, or by the Justice 25 Department, they are all part of the Justice Gore Perry Reporting and Video FAX 314-241-6750 314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com d5c6c720-281 b-4bd3-b556-f277 df197 ecc

And so, but all of that will be 7 traded. We're giving them all the statements we 8 have, they are passing statements and any other 9 information that they have on this matter back to 10 us. 11 So it is still independent of one another, 12 but sharing the information because what is 13 significant to this case is also significant to 14 theirs. They are looking at different 15 possibilities. 16 The federal government and the state 17 government are not the same. We have these criminal 18 charges, they look at potential civil rights 19 violations, but for the same conduct that we are 20 looking at for any potential criminal violations. 21 So that may add a little bit, a little bit 22 of a delay. I really don't want to say a delay, but 23 kind of giving things to you out of order here 24 somewhat. Like a trial, lots of information is 25 going to come to you and it is going to come out of Gore Perry Reporting and Video FAX 314-241-6750 314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com d5c6c720-281 b-4bd3-b556-f277 df197 ecc

The schedule is just that. 3 There will be time if we have a particular 4 area, just for example, the DNA evidence. If that 5 is available or when that is available and all of it 6 is available, not just part of it, we will have the 7 time that is in the next two weeks to present that 8 to you all at once. If it is a number of witness 9 statements, we will present all of those to you. We 10 will have it all organized and bring it in. 11 By the time everything is finished, you 12 will have heard everything, you will have every 13 statement, there will be as many witnesses to come 14 in and testify. 15 If they made statements, you will not only 16 get the statements they made, whether they are to 17 police, FBI, or television or on the internet or 18 anything else. If we've got those statements, you 19 will have those statements. You will also have the 20 witness who will come in and testify as to that. 21 Some certainly might be they are just 22 statements that are floating around on the internet 23 and nobody knows who is making that statement, but 24 everybody is doing that and the FBI is doing what 25 they can to locate any of those or the source of Gore Perry Reporting and Video FAX 314-241-6750 314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com d5c6c720-281 b-4bd3-b556-f277 df197 ecc

All 6 you get is that so you won't have the docket. There 7 will be another grand jury that starts the week 8 after that who will be doing what you have been 9 doing for the past four months. 10 By the way, greatly appreciate your 11 service on that. I don't want to lose that in the 12 message here. You have done a great job, a great 13 service for the people of this county. 14 But the schedule will then, it is as 15 flexible as flexible can be. It is the only matter 16 that you have and so there is no requirement that 17 you meet on Wednesdays. So whenever all 12 people 18 are available, because all the evidence will be 19 presented to all 12, so we get all 12 of you 20 together, we will work with everybody's schedule. 21 Obviously, we want to be as expeditious as 22 possible, but not rush through it. If that means we 23 are meeting four hours in the morning and whatever 24 works is what we are going to do. Saturdays, 25 evenings, however it works for everybody's schedule, Gore Perry Reporting and Video FAX 314-241-6750 314-241-6750 www.goreperry.com d5c6c720-281 b-4bd3-b556-f277 df197 ecc
