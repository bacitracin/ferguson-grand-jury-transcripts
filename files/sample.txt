INTRODUCTION 

MR.  MCCULLOCH:  Thank  you. 

I'm  Bob 

shooting  death  of  Michael  Brown. 

First  things  first.  Let  me  introduce,  I 

I  want  to  tell  you  how  this  is  going  to 
proceed.  Obviously,  it  is  going  to  be  different 
from  a  lot  of  the  other  cases  that  you've  heard, 
that  you've  heard  during  your  term. 

1

3  McCulloch,  the  Prosecutor,  for  the  record. 
I  want 
4 
to  talk  to  you  a  little  bit  about  this.  As  you  are 
5  well  aware  of  what  we  are  here  about  and  that  is  the

say  a  lot  of  this  you  already  know.  These  two 
12 
13 
ladies,  for  the  record,  Kathi  Alizadeh,  Shelia 
14  Whirley,  they  will  be  the  primary,  if  not  the

23 
24  minutes  of  the  time  the  County  Police  were  notified

Obviously,  I  hope,  obviously,  there  be  a 
lot  of  other  people  working  on  things  outside  of  us 
getting  it  ready  for  the  presentation  that  will  be 
made  by  Kathi  and/or  Sheila. 

for  the  month  of  August  for  all  homicide  calls.  So 
she  received  the  call  about  this  shooting  within

this  case. 

by  the  Ferguson  Police. 

So  she  has  been  working 

Kathi  was  the  prosecutor  I  have  on  call

There  are  a  few  things  I  do  want  to  go 

since  the  very  beginning. 

My  procedure  is  always  that  I  have  a 

prosecutor  on  call  solely  for  homicide  cases  and 
they  stay  with  that  case  from  start  to  finish, 

Sheila,  as  you  know,  has  been  assigned  to 

the  grand  jury  for  this  term  and  so  she  will 
continue  with  this  grand  jury  on  this  case  for  as 
long  as  it  does  take.

over,  first  and  foremost,  to  tell  you  that  this  is 
the  first,  last  and  probably  the  only  time  I  think 
that  you  will  see  me  in  relation  to  this  case. 

everything  that  you  do,  will  be  recorded  with  the 
court  reporter,  who  is  under  the  same  oath, 
essentially,  as  all  the  witnesses. 

As  I  said,  Kathi  and  Sheila  will  be  the 
primary  attorneys,  the  attorneys  responsible  for 
presenting  everything  to  the  grand  jury. 

things  to  make  sure  that  we  have  kind  of  the  ground 
rules,  but  the  procedure  covered. 

Really,  I'm  going  to  go  over  just  a  few 

As  you  know,  your  term  ends  on  the  lOth  of

presentations  on  this  case. 

This  case  is  still  in  the  middle  of  an 

September.  You  also  have  dockets,  there  is  no 
docket  next  week,  but  on  the  3rd  and  lOth,  we  have 
dockets.  Those  dockets  will  be  adjusted,  but  they 

investigation,  there  is  a  lot  going  on  and  certainly 
you  are  well  aware  of  what's  going  on  in  the 
evenings  and  during  the  day  and  even  out  in  front  of 
the  courthouse  here  on  occasions.

Department. 

As  that  is  going  back  and  forth  and  there 
is  some  witnesses  they  will  be  talking  to  that  the 
County  Police  may  not  necessarily  be  talking  to. 
Some  that  the  County  had  talked  to  that  they  haven't 
or  won't  talk  to.  And  so,  but  all  of  that  will  be 
traded.  We're  giving  them  all  the  statements  we 
have,  they  are  passing  statements  and  any  other 
information  that  they  have  on  this  matter  back  to 
us. 

So  it  is  still  independent  of  one  another, 

but  sharing  the  information  because  what  is 
significant  to  this  case  is  also  significant  to 
theirs.  They  are  looking  at  different 
possibilities. 

The  federal  government  and  the  state 

government  are  not  the  same.  We  have  these  criminal 
charges,  they  look  at  potential  civil  rights 
violations,  but  for  the  same  conduct  that  we  are 
looking  at  for  any  potential  criminal  violations. 

So  that  may  add  a  little  bit,  a  little  bit

going  to  come  to  you  and  it  is  going  to  come  out  of

everybody  is  doing  that  and  the  FBI  is  doing  what 
they  can  to  locate  any  of  those  or  the  source  of 

statement,  there  will  be  as  many  witnesses  to  come 
in  and  testify. 

If  they  made  statements,  you  will  not  only 

get  the  statements  they  made,  whether  they  are  to 
police,  FBI,  or  television  or  on  the  internet  or 
anything  else.
