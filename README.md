### Conversion
The Ferguson Grand Just testimony PDF is 5000 pages long. It was transcribed over 100 days by different people, so the formatting is all over the place. There is also a lot of redacted content. We've done the best we can to get these transcripts up and live. Done is better than perfect. Compare anything that looks weird to the official released PDF.

### PDF to text script
`parse_transcript_xml.py` is a script that parses the XML files created by running pdf2txt.py (PDFMiner) on the OCR Transcripts.

The XML files generated by PDFMiner preserve formatting information which we can use to more accurately identify text attributed to individuals whose names have been redacted from the transcript, by examining text indentations.

The XML file of the full transcript can be generated with the command:
`pdf2txt.py -o ferguson_grand_jury_testimony.xml Ferguson\ Grand\ Jury\ Testimony.pdf`
